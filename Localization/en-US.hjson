					1: Here's another Essence you can use. It'll make a Ranged-type weapon with unique properties. Something tells me it's cursed, so..
					2: Good luck! I did warn you.
					3: Here is another Essence for you. Looks like this fancy sewing needle has some pretty powerful movement capabilities.
					4: Keep up the good work!
					5: Here is another Essence for you. It looks to be a rather powerful melee weapon.
					6: That's it for now. Keep up the good work!
					7: Another Essence for you. This firey sword is classified as Magic. It seems to explode when sufficiently charged.
					8: I trust you'll know what to do.
					9: An Essence is here for your use. This powerful Melee heirloom is said to cleave the way for those less fortunate.
					10: Good luck in crafting it.
					11: This Essence is a personal creation of mine! It creates a Magic weapon that lets you enter the 'Butterfly Trance' and gain special bonuses!
					12: Please, use it if you can. I can always use more data!
					13: This Essence creates a Ranged gun that perpetuates itself after killing foes! Feel the heat!!
					14: Ahem. Please consider it in your arsenal.
					15: This Essence is a Ranged weapon that defeats foes with a swarm of powerful nanites. Truly fearful.
					16: If your gear supports it, try crafting this weapon!
					17: This Essence is another Ranged weapon that allows for powerful charged attacks. Fully charged, it splits and hits multiple foes!
					18: Hey. Aren't we getting too many Ranged weapons? I'll try and find something else next time.
					19: This is a legendary Melee artifact! The weapon this Essence crafts can inflict a crippling debuff on any foe!
					20: This Essence will create a support item this time. It'll give powerful buffs to you and your friends if you can keep it up.
					21: The Warrior of Light has inspired this Essence. It appears to be a key to a gateway of infinite weapons, doing Summon damage.
					22: If you feel inspired, try referring to your foes as mongrels.
					23: This Essence creates a Ranged weapon with a high Mana cost, and an incredibly high critical damage modifier.
					24: Exploitable? Surely. Theorycraft is all you.
					25: This is a Summon weapon. It seems to have very unique scaling properties, and attacks incredibly quickly.
					26: It's also a reflection of your heart... or something. I don't really get that stuff.
					27: This is a Summoner weapon, but you'll use it like a Melee weapon. It has the power to swap places instantly with a set place.
					28: While dangerous, it looks to be pretty powerful. Surely you won't get hit.. right?
					29: This is a pretty unique weapon. When using it, it'll follow-up your attacks, and become stronger when you spend Mana.
					30: This Essence hails from a world embroiled in conflict... It boasts incredible power, but if you get too overzealous, it'll start to hurt you.
					31: This Essence creates a Melee weapon that can swap between sword, scythe, or gun. You will be able to use it in nearly any situation!
					32: Okay, here's a new Essence for you. It's a huge Melee lance that can be swap between a lance form and a gun form. It looks to be pretty strong!
					33: Well {0}, take this Essence. This Melee weapon has an incredible burst, but the refractory period may be dangerous.. Give it a shot, though!
					34: Here's another Essence you can use! It has incredible synergy with Summons and gets stronger as you do, so if you plan on fighting with allies, this is it!
					35: Right, I have an Essence for you. It's a Summon weapon that conjures this mysterious sentient star. It's.. too cute. Anyways...
					36: It looks to be a powerful weapon, but you'll have to collect the Star Bits for full effect- meaning getting in the way of danger. Good luck..!
					37: Okay. I've got another Essence for you. This Melee weapon can swap between five different forms, granting powerful buffs in the process.
					38: Here's a Magic-type Essence. It'll make a scythe with incredible reach and balances between light and dark. Now THAT sounds cool. Right? Right.
					39: Here's another Essence for your use. This powerful Melee blade can deal powerful damage to all foes in your vicinity. How useful is that?
					40: Here's another Essence you can prepare to use, from Penthesilea's strength. With its magical paint, we should be able to best powerful foes.
					41: Here you go: an essence for usage in crafting. It looks like it'll apply powerful bouts of flame and frost alike. Not how I'd want to go out, personally.
					42: Whoa, this is a powerful Essence. It's potential seems to be magnified based on your Aspected Damage Type. How about giving it a go?
					43: Okay..! Time for another Essence! This looks to be a Ranged weapon with high damage output at close range.
					44: This new Essence is great! It's a Ranged weapon with crazy high explosive potential. Just point it towards the bad guys.
					45: I have a new Essence for you. This is a magical Summon-type weapon that seems to scale with your own potential. Interesting..!
					46: A Magic Essence is here this time. With cosmic energy, you can blast foes away with superpowered light. Sounds good to me!
					47: This Melee-type Essence should help. It looks to be a multiple-purpose power-suit with myriad attacks. Now that sounds cool!
					48: Okay {0}, I have an Essence for you! It seems to create a Magic-type weapon with powerful piercing damage... It sounds rather helpful.
					49: I've found another Essence you can use... I think. The only thing I can tell is that it makes a Ranged weapon. The rest is up to you.
					50: Okay- I've got it. Here's a Ranged-type Essence.. it looks to be something pretty powerful! Good luck.
					51: A Summon weapon's essence is here. It looks suspiciously like a whip... but it also can summon minions? Now that's peak.
					52: What? 'Peak?' It's new age lingo- You've definitely heard it before. You know? Like.. mountain peak? The top.. of something? Never mind.
					53: Okay- this is a Melee weapon! My instincts tell me it's perfect for high-defense foes. What are you waiting for?
					54: This Melee blade can harness the power of the elements themselves. Just having it in your hands is quite something!
					55: This looks to be a Magic weapon. With its power, you can call down entire stars to defeat your foes!
					56: You're worried you'll run out eventually? Yeah.. no.
					57: This looks to be... a Magic weapon. Strange- it feels like an entire armory is contained in this Essence. How's that possible?
					58: Well, I'll let you figure that one out. Get to it- I'm curious too, you know?
					59: Here's a Magic weapon for your usage. Looks to me like it's pretty complicated- you're up to the task though, right?
					60: Right.. Here's a Ranged-type weapon Essence.  I hope you've built up your chemical tolerance- it seems to utilize chemical energy to deal powerful damage.
					61: Behold- a new Essence! It's Melee damage this time. It has some incredible lifesteal powers- but also seems to drain your health on use? How about giving it a go?
					62: Here's a Summon weapon. It's.. Well, it's a whip, but it has some unique magical properties. It has good striking power, too!
					63: Listen close, {0}! Or not. This Magic weapon is a giant horn, but get this: you can whack people with it! Rad!
					64: Careful with this Essence- Apparently, only the worthy can wield it at full strength.
					65: An ancient civilization's magnum opus, it seems. Don't underestimate its destructive power.
					66: Look here, another Essence..! It's going to be Magic-type. It seems to revolve around balancing Black and White Mana to attack.
					67: It seems that they were opposites, at least where this thing came from. Makes you wonder...
					68: Thanks for waiting. Here's another Melee-type Essence for your use. While it's deceptively close-ranged, it has the potential for some crazy burst damage.
					69: Sure, it'll most likely burn you up from the inside. Just a little, though.
					70: Okay, here's an unorthodox Essence for you. While it functions as a pretty strong pickaxe, it looks like it also has some great damage potential.
					71: From my take, it seems to be a great off-hand weapon to pump out explosions. Everyone loves explosions, right?
					72: Here's a Ranged weapon- it has both a useful primary fire and can unleash strong self-sustaining drones to attack as well.
					73: I've got a new weapon for you: it's a powerful mid-range blade, with the ability to conjure a crystal which can alter your combat style. Interesting, huh?
					74: This is an Essence that'll turn into a pair of gloves. Now, I know what you're thinking, but let me explain.
					75: These gloves can conjure a whole arsenal of weapons for you to wield. Complicated, but it'll be very powerful if used right.
					76: Right. This Melee Essence dips into the void to defeat foes and absorb them after. Sounds pretty cool to me.
					77: I've acquired a new Essence for your use. It seems to borrow strength from Melee and Magic both- a versatile weapon, I like it!
					78: Looks like this Graveyard seems to have some connection to this Essence. Hopefully all these graves weren't just from you dying, right?
					79: Hmm... this Summon-type Essence will create some sort of controllable drone- I wonder if it can talk?
					80: This is certainly a Melee weapon- furthermore, it seems to be one that excels at a distance, as well as providing extra firepower in close combat. Nice.
					81: I plundered a Ranged-sort of essence from the likeness of those pirates. Sea... water... Actually, looks like I'm nearly dry with jokes, so I'll anchor myself now.
					82: Well, I'm not sure what to make of this Essence, other than that it's a Summon weapon. Best you give it a go, before anything else goes haywire.
					83: This watch is a Summon-type weapon- looks like it'll call forth a cute time-aspected ally. She'll help with support if you can work with her combat style.
					84: Hmm... Perhaps you could even use it to dodge incoming attacks...?
					86: Looks like this Essence is both Magic and Melee aspected- it crackles with lightning already. How about giving it a shot?
					85: It looks to me like this Ranged-weapon has the ability to down hordes of foes pretty easily. Sounds like it'll come in handy- especially the giant coffin swings!
					87: How about this Essence? It'll give you an enhanced barrier, able to protect yourself while helping you deal some damage without worry of repercussions.
					88: Seems that this Essence came from that voodoo doll we found in the Underworld- a strange sight. Are you certain that using a weapon like this is worth the risk?
					89: Who am I kidding- of course you're certain! You're MY Starbearer, after all! Just don't get TOO reckless, now.
					90: This Essence is aspected to this world's star- your sun! Needless to say, the power of the sun would be quite the boon- let's see this thing in action!
					91: Hmm, I'd advise healthy amounts of caution with this Essence- it's a Melee essence with high potential, but it looks like you're leaving your defenses open for it.
					92: Looks to me like this Magic Essence has some powerful potential, but I'm not quite sure what it requires in turn... Perhaps you should give it a look.
					93: You aren't going to believe this, but someone gave this Essence to me- how is that possible? They said something like 'It's just a game, so it's OK.' What even?
					94: This Ranged-essence seems to lead to a classic rocket-launcher weapon- I've heard of using explosives for traversal, so it shouldn't hurt to try, right?
					95: This Magic Essence is pretty unique: you can draw directly onto the world to cause different effects to occur.
					96: Looks like a yo-yo Essence is here- a Summon-type one as well. Seems to boast some helpful movement tools as well!
				}

				Eridani: {
					1: Here's a Ranged-type essence. It looks like every fourth shot has increased offensive properties. Whatever the reason, it's powerful.
					2: Here you are: another Essence. This one will create a Summon-type weapon. I trust you know what that means?
					3: I'm telling you to try it out.
					4: You knew that? Never mind then.
					5: I have quite the unique Essence for you. It looks to be a chainsaw imbued with the strength of a dog god.. Or so it seems.
					6: Whatever it may be, it should prove useful to you. Ignore the fact that it talks.
					7: I've gotten an Essence for you. This one will create a Magic-type weapon. Apparently, proper timing is needed to better utilize this weapon.
					8: I have no doubts you can get a handle on it easily. Okay, saying 'no doubts' would be a lie. Maybe 1/4th of a doubt.
					9: This Magic Essence channels void energies to empower you with unique attacks, but don't get too attached. Void stuff is always dangerous.
					10: The weapon made from this Essence is based around music.. Timing your swings will be critical in using this to its fullest.
					11: Even holding it makes you feel a certain type of beat...
					12: This Essence will create a legendary weapon made for slaying dragons. Jump into the air and pierce your foes with its strength.
					13: It's a Melee weapon, so craft it if you can fit it in your arsenal.
					14: This Magic weapon will gain critical chance when shooting, and each crit will deal increased damage. It's powerful stuff.
					15: Consider it if you're able.
					16: This Ranged weapon allows you to enter a Melee stance, dealing more damage to foes you've hit with arrows. It should be quite engaging.
					17: This powerful Melee relic allows for the expidenture of Mana to teleport and deal powerful damage. It's a new favorite of mine.
					18: This weapon is made straight from the power of the Moon Lord and its spatial pillars. It'll do good in your hands.
					19: From the Warrior of Light.. this Essence allows for the usage of Limit Break. It's an incredibly strong Magic weapon.
					20: The Light will cleanse your sins! Or something like that.
					21: This weapon can switch between Ranged and Magic. If you time its reload correctly, it always does critical damage.
					22: I'm sure you can think of something that works around that...
					23: This powerful weapon allows you to use Skill Orbs to unleash special moves. It also has a super-powered burst window. It's a Melee weapon.
					24: You'd be well off with it in your hands.. but it does mean you have to get up close. I don't envy you.
					25: This is a Summon weapon. Holding it summons two cannons to orbit you, and you can fire from both of them. Each of them apply a different debuff.
					26: The important part is using the other weapon to trigger the other weapon's debuff. You can figure it out.
					27: Here's another Summon weapon. You can attack normally with it, but striking foes with the Timepieces empowers the weapon's attacks.
					28: Did I mention you can go back in time? It's powerful, for sure.
					29: This Essence allows for the creation of unique dual blades which offer varying effects, and allows you to leave your body to overwhelm foes.
					30: This Essence is utilized in the creation of a Melee Weapon. What sets it apart is the ability to manifest as a sword, scythe, or gun.
					31: Here's a new weapon for you to craft. This lance can swap between close and long range, and it can also be charged to great effect.
					32: This is for you, {0}. It's a super-powered Melee weapon that has an incredible burst phase, followed by a weakness phase. Good luck using it.
					33: I have another Essence for you. This weapon is a Summon weapon that works in harmony with minions, and it gets stronger as you do.
					34: I have another Essence for you to use. This Summon-type wand calls forth this adorable little sentient star, and it just looks so.. squishable..
					35: ...Looking past that. You'll have to get up close to use the Star Bits, but they do quite a number on foes if you can land them.
					36: I've given you another Essence. This is a Melee weapon that can morph between five different forms, changing the weapon's usage. Interesting.
					37: Here is another Essence. For you. This is a Summon weapon that will transform you as well as summon crystal shards that weaken and attack nearby foes.
					38: Hmm.. It's the Essence of Hope, but is there something else lurking beneath the surface? Who knows..
					39: Right... Here's another Essence. This Melee weapon allows you to damage all nearby foes in a huge area. It should be quite useful.
					40: This is another Essence you can master. It will allow you to use Penthesilea's ink to supress foes and strike bosses powerfully.
					41: Okay, I have another Essence for your battles. It summons a mystical fox that burns your enemies with icy energy. They might even deserve it, too.
					42: It looks like this next Essence is a strong one. Aspected Damage Type seems to empower the weapon further...
					43: I've located another Essence for your use. It seems this Ranged-type weapon is hyperfocused on movement. How about pairing it with some mobility tools..?
					44: Another Essence is yours. It's a strong Ranged weapon with incredibly good room-clearing power. How about that?
					45: Here's another Essence for you to use. It looks to be a Summon-type weapon that grows in strength with the use of more minion summons.
					46: Here's a Magic-type Essence. With the power of the stars, you can melt even the strongest of foes. Give it a try..?
					47: A Melee Essence is here this time. With its strength, you can create a multifaceted weapon that swaps its arsenal instantly in combat.
					48: I have an Essence for you, {0}. Looks like it'll become a Summon-type weapon... and it gains strength from grazing danger? You'll have to try it.
					49: This is another powerful Essence. Looks like it's a Melee weapon, and it has the potential to execute foes. Don't underestimate it.
					50: Time for another essence- this time it's a Ranged-type weapon. Seems to be pretty powerful at general destruction.
					51: Here's another weapon. Looks to be a summon-type whip that can deploy spider-robots to attack foes.
					52: They're spiders... but not real spiders. Yep- thinking like that will stop the fight or flight response. Take notes!
					53: This is a Melee weapon. It has pretty good anti-armor properties- you can definitely put that to good use.
					54: Another weapon is here. It seems to be a Melee weapon- one that uses the power of the elements to attack foes.
					55: This Magic-type staff will be incredibly helpful, if I do say so myself. It has the strength to conjure entire stars!
					56: As long as they aren't REAL stars. There would be... a few problems.
					57: Here's another weapon- Magic, it seems. There's something strange about it- this Essence seems to hold the strength of myriad weapons together.
					58: Here's another unique Magic weapon. Looks to be rather complicated, so good luck using it. Don't forget the ABCs- always be casting!
					59: Although, I'm not too sure that it applies here.
					60: This Essence sources a Ranged weapon. It has a high focus on tight mobility, meaning it'll put you into the front lines. The strength should compensate.
					61: A Melee-type Essence is prepared this time. It seems to me like it sacrifies your health for powerful area-of-effect damage. Use it well, but know the risks.
					62: Right, here's a Summon-type whip. It has some magic capability, but it's a bit random in its casting. Try and use it well.
					63: Be careful with this Essence- for some reason, it discharges static electricity all the time.
					64: It'll create a Summon weapon. Hopefully the electric properties carry over- it's sure to give our foes a shock.
					65: This Essence leads to a truly powerful weapon. It bears remnants of an ancient, advanced civilization.
					66: Evidently, they bore proficiency in spatial manipulation. I'd like you to give it a try, but it might reject the unworthy.
					67: At this point, I wonder if there was a weapon you weren't worthy to wield. Yes, I'm praising you.
					68: This Magic-type Essence balances attack and healing through the dual-use of Black and White mana.
					69: Two opposite schools of learning, at least in this Essence's original world. Now isn't that thought-provoking.
					70: Apologies for the delay- here's an Essence. This Melee weapon has some recoil potential, but in exchange you could deal some explosive amounts of damage.
					71: I'd ask you to use it in moderation, but I'm sure you'll use it as much as you like. Bring some healing potions, at the very least.
					72: This Essence focuses on excavation as well as damage. You can use it to move earth at significant rates, and additionally deal powerful explosive damage.
					73: Here's a Ranged weapon- it has both a useful primary fire and can unleash strong self-sustaining drones to attack as well.
					74: I've a new Celestial weapon for your use. It'll be more powerful when you utilize its strength to summon a Prismic, which can assist you in battle.
					75: Here's a new weapon for your use. In truth, this Essence is a bit more than that; it's a pair of gloves.
					76: Of course, that's not the whole story- you can use these gloves to summon an entire arsenal of weapons.
					77: I know the prospect sounds daunting, but you'll deal some heavy damage if you can manage the weapons well.
					78: Okay, here's a Melee weapon- with the power of souls, you can cleave huge areas around you and dip into the void itself for instant teleportation.
					79: Looks to be a new Essence for your use. It uses a unique damage type and powerful charge attacks- but it'll probably have some recoil damage.
					80: This Graveyard seems to have connected to this Essence. I hope it'll help you avoid creating the Graveyard in the first place.
					81: While powerful, I believe it's a utility item, and not a weapon this time.
					82: This Magic Essence, while aspected to nature, seems rather volatile. Perhaps you'd be able to better use it in tandem with other weapons?
					83: This Melee weapon harnesses an aspect of time itself to help you in combat. It seems to have some impressive range, as well.
					84: How about it; that previous... um, let's say 'get-together' with those pirates has churned up an Essence- Ranged damage, from what I can tell. Here you are.
					85: I'm not sure how to define this Summon-type Essence, so I'll leave it as an exercise for you. Well... good luck.
					86: This Summon-type weapon conjures a rather charming time-aspected being. She'll help with both offensive and defensive duties.
					87: This essence is a Ranged-type weapon, but it seems to have a lot of close-ranged action. Don't get overzealous, but do try to make the most of it.
					88: Seems like this is a Melee and Magic type Essence in tandem. From what I can see, it'll make a powerful weapon that channels the power of lightning.
					89: This Essence is a support-type item. It'll provide a powerful barrier and allow you to sap life energy from your foes as well... It'll be quite the powerful tool.
					90: This Essence seems to have resonated from that strange poppet we found in the Underworld. Beware its dangers- your affinity with resurrection is... tentative.
					91: An Essence attuned to the power of our Sun- and it is quite radiant, indeed. Let's make good use of it.
					92: This Essence exudes an unhealthy amount of madness- it's a Melee weapon that trades defensive prowess for offensive might. Do be careful.
					93: A Magic-type essence. It seems to harbor incredible power, but it also seems to require sacrifices in return...
					94: How can I say this...? Unlike the other Essences, I felt a presence give this one to me. They said something like... 'It's just a game, so it's OK.'
					95: It seems to be able to absorb hostile energy and use it to empower you in turn. I, too, am curious on how it looks.
					96: This Ranged-type rocket launcher has a unique melee counterpart, but it requires you to- well, I hope you have strong legs.
					97: Take into consideration this Magic essence: in short, it turns the world into a canvas you can interact and attack with.
					98: Here is a new Essence for your perusal- it'll deal Summon damage. It's rather close-ranged but boasts movement capabilities to help close the gap.
				}

				Perseus: {
					1: It's good to see you again, {0}. I'm not here to ask for your help- instead, I have a gift for you.
					2: You have proven yourself as a true warrior; as such, you should have a weapon befitting your strength.
					3: So, I bestow this weapon unto you. Good luck, and good hunting.
				}

			BossDialogue: {
				KingSlime: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: You've defeated the Slime King, huh? Good job.
						2: It may have been rather weak, but it's a surefire step forwards nevertheless.
						3: Did anyone else see that ninja thing? Was it just me?
						4: Somehow.. it was strong enough to unlock a part of the Stellar Array! Check it out later, OK?
						5: ...Well, that's all for now. Keep it up.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: It may have seemed weak, but the Slime King was truly quite the threat.
						2: Let's hope it stays dead. I know slimes aren't a big fan of that.
						3: Something about this foe has unlocked a part of the Stellar Array. Perhaps it was fiercer than usual?
						4: However, if it does return, you should be able to easily defeat it anew; that's usually how it goes.
					}
				}

				CthulhuEye: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: "'Eye of Cthulhu'? "
						2: Doesn't that imply there would be more of this 'Cthulhu'?
						3: If it ever reared its head, it would be quite the formidable foe indeed.
						4: Let's prepare for that occasion... Just in case.
						5: Hey.. defeating that foe was enough! Looks like an ability in the Stellar Array is ready.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: For how fearsome it looked, the Eye of Cthulhu wasn't too terrible, was it?
						2: It seems to have shed its skin to display quite an array of teeth.
						3: If I didn't know better, it looked like it was trying to prove something. Weirdo.
						4: In other news.. an ability in the Stellar Array is now available. Use it well.
					}
				}

				CorruptionBoss: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Huh. I guess there really was more 'Cthulhu.' Somehow, it doesn't suprise me as much as I would have thought.
						2: Glad we stopped that thing before it lived up to its name.
						3: Those materials are... something... Wow- the smell.
						4: Hey, the weapons that you can make from it look pretty powerful! What do you think?
						5: Looks like an ability has unlocked in the Stellar Array. You should definitely consider it.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Another organ of this 'Cthulhu' and it attacked with magical manipulation... Also- yuck?
						2: This 'Eater of Worlds' was just a big worm. I'm kind of disappointed. Let's file a complaint with whomever named this thing.
						3: Looks like it unlocked an ability in the Stellar Array. Look it over when you're free.
					}
				}

				QueenBee: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Well, I guess I should have expected something like this within the Jungle.
						2: Good work. Looks like another ability is unlocked in the Stellar Array as well.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Seriously? A giant bee... Somehow, I might prefer it over smaller insects... Easier to hit, you know.
						2: Ahem. At the very least, it unlocked an ability in the Stellar Array.
					}
				}

				Skeletron: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: The Clothier was truly a gigantic evil skeleton monster.. Cute. At the very least, you have access to the Dungeon now.
						2: And with this, another ability is unlocked in the Stellar Array.
						3: Well, that's all for now.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: That poor Clothier, cursed to become Skeletron. It seems his defeat has granted us access to the Dungeon. This may be in bad taste, but...
						2: If the embodiment of your emotions is a huge monster... maybe, just maybe, the curse wasn't the sole factor.
						3: If anyone asks, you didn't hear that from me.
					}
				}

				WallOfFlesh: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Whoa.. I've never seen anything like this.. ever. The entire world seems to be bursting with new magical energy.
						2: It looks like the Wall of Flesh was either guarding or preventing something drastic from happening. That's my take on it.
						3: Just to let you know, there's another upgrade in the Stellar Array now. It seems to be more powerful than the ones you've used before.
						4: Also, it seems to have dropped something.. Whatever it is, it feels.. familiar. Please be careful, but I can't deny I'm curious.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Wow.. the world itself seems to have been drastically altered after the defeat of the Wall of Flesh...
						2: I've never seen anything like it. What was this thing hiding...?
						3: This power seems to have activated the first Tier 2 ability in the Stellar Array. I hope you can utilize it well.
						4: Something else dropped from it. I'm not sure what it is, but it feels like I should know. Be mindful of what could go wrong.
					}
				}

				Twins: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: So someone went and made two Eyes instead of one? Good for them, but in my opinion, the design is kind of ruined already.
						2: If you're going to make a robot eye, try and hide the obvious weak spot where the iris is. Well, I don't create giant evil robotic eyes, so they got me there.
						3: It looks as if another upgrade is available in the Stellar Array. That's it for now.
						4: That's about all for now.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Well, those mechanical facsimiles are dead. We're not rating boss monsters, or anything, but... I'm going to have to dock some points.
						2: Why would you ever even think about using flesh for the exterior? In terms of material, you've got to have better options, if you're already going all this way.
						3: It looks as if yet another upgrade is available in the Stellar Array. Pretty serendipitous.
						4: That's all for now.
					}
				}

				Destroyer: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: "'The Destroyer...' I'm not one to talk, but if you name something 'The Destroyer' I'm gonna expect more than a big worm."
						2: Its absurd length was just a detriment to its strength. Take notes, {0}.
						3: It looks as if another upgrade is available in the Stellar Array.
						4: I guess that's all I have for now.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: I guess the Destroyer was more bark than bite, huh. Maybe too much of the budget was spent on the design aspect.
						2: In theory, we could technically salvage some of its bits, but it's probably more trouble than its worth.
						3: It looks as if yet another upgrade is available in the Stellar Array. Pretty serendipitous.
						4: That's all for now.
					}
				}

				SkeletronPrime: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: You've done it! Skeletron Prime has been defeated. A bit of a monster, huh?
						2: The appendages were a smart idea. Almost got you a few times there.
						3: It looks as if another upgrade is available in the Stellar Array.
						4: I guess that's all I have for now.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: And that takes care of Skeletron Prime. It certainly looked the part... if you're a total edgelord.
						2: If you took offense, I apologize. You can be as edgy as you want. Anyways...
						3: It looks as if yet another upgrade is available in the Stellar Array. Pretty serendipitous.
						4: That's all for now.
					}
				}

				AllMechs: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Actually.. It looks like you've bested all the Mechanical Bosses! This is definitely, 100% a step forward.
						2: This victory has lead to another upgrade in- you guessed it, the Stellar Array. Did it keep you waiting?
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: It seems that was the last of the Mechanical Bosses. This is a great step forward!
						2: This victory has brought another upgrade to the Stellar Array. Hopefully you weren't kept too long.
					}
				}

				Plantera: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: And there it goes.. the terror of the jungle, Plantera. Congratulations on your victory.
						2: I sense the Dungeon has changed... and that temple in the Jungle is now available. It's your choice what to tackle next.
						3: Another upgrade is now available in the Stellar Array, too.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: That marks the end of Plantera. Very good work. You should be able to access the Jungle Temple now.
						2: I also believe there's new materials to be found within the Dungeon. We'll just have to... take it by force.
						3: Another upgrade has been unlocked in the Stellar Array, as well.
					}
				}

				Golem: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: You've done it! Golem is no more. You're unstoppable.
						2: Something about our next enemy feels.. dangerous. It seems spatial energy has congregated around the Dungeon's entrance.
						3: Another upgrade is now available in the Stellar Array. Looks pretty strong.
						4: Well, that's about everything.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: The Lizhard Temple's beast Golem is confirmed dead.  In terms of mechanical beasts, I'm kind of.. disappointed?
						2: Something strange has appeared in front of the Dungeon. It seems otherwordly in nature... Be prepared for anything.
						3: Another upgrade has been unlocked in the Stellar Array, as well.
						4: That's about everything.
					}
				}

				DukeFishron: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Such a powerful creature hiding deep within the Ocean.. Luckily, you avoided being turned into fish food.
						2: Where did that saying even come from..? What IS fish food? More important questions left unanswered...
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Duke Fishron has been defeated. That was a close one, but you've o-fish-ally won. ...
						2: I might have fished too hard for that one. You know what..? Let's leave the puns to Asphodene. I concede there's a certain skill to it.
					}
				}

				Cultist: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: These Celestial Pillars, they can't be good news- we really can't catch a break.
						2: Don't lose hope, though... we can beat this. Just another foe to defeat, right? Haha...
						3: Before you go, there's something else I need to tell you. I can sense something else other than the Pillars.
						4: I can't quite place it, but I have the feeling like you should take advantage of nighttime soon.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: I knew it.. something wasn't right about that Cultist. These Celestial Pillars do not inspire confidence.
						2: With our current circumstances, I think you're the only one with a good enough shot at besting this threat.
						3: One more thing: I can sense something other than the Pillars approaching. It is entirely different in nature.
						4: This is only a hunch, but I would advise you to proceed with any tasks that require the night soon.
					}
				}

				MoonLord: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: You've done it! The Moon Lord has been vanquished- I knew you could do it.
						2: The Moon Lord's defeat has strengthened your Stellar Array. A reward well deserved.
						3: We've come a long way... You have grown stronger than I've ever imagined!
						4: We deserve a well-earned break. Somehow, I feel like our troubles aren't quite over yet...
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: The Moon Lord has been defeated... What a wonderful victory.
						2: Looks like its defeat has granted the Stellar Array even more power.
						3: I fear our journey isn't over yet. We must press onwards. In fact...
						4: I have a sneaking suspicion that things aren't going to stay peaceful for long. Let's stay vigilant.
					}
				}

				WarriorOfLight: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: I see we were wrong.. The Warrior thought he was saving the galaxy, but it was truly the lies of the First Starfarer.. How cruel.
						2: Anyways, the Warrior of Light. He managed to get away, but... Night has returned to this world, finally!
						3: We finally have the last piece of the puzzle. The First Starfarer showed her hand, and this means we have a chance.
						4: The Stellar Array is yet stronger- something we'll need in the coming conflict, I believe.
						5: Once you've collected all the Mnemonic Traces, craft them together with use of the Celestriad Root.
						6: I probably don't need to tell you this, but she's not going to parley. Prepare for a hard fight.. Perhaps the hardest fight so far.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: You have brought down the Warrior of Light. He's managed to escape, but nighttime has returned to this world regardless.
						2: It seems we were misguided. The Warrior believed he was saving the galaxy, but it was, in truth, all lies from his Starfarer.
						3: With this final Mnemonic Trace.. I see.. It all makes sense now. {0}, I need you to combine all of the Mnemonic Traces together.
						4: You'll have to utilize the Observatory's Celestriad Root.
						5: Not all is lost, however. We've gained some strength from the Warrior of Light in the Stellar Array.
						6: Remember: the First Starfarer. We can not let this opportunity slip away. This will likely be the fight of our lives.. Prepare yourself well.
					}
				}

				AllVanillaBosses: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: You've defeated so many powerful foes- you must be nearing the pinnacle of your powers, for sure.
						2: How can I tell? Well... there's a new Stellar Array ability available, to boot.
						3: Here's a little gift, from me to you. It's an Essence of a past Starfarer- you'll be able to use it well.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: You've come quite far- I'm sure our enemies shudder when they think of you.
						2: I'm seriously proud of your growth. In fact, you've gained the strength of a new Stellar Array ability from it.
						3: It may not be the best reward, but this Essence of a past Starfarer should be quite helpful to you.
						4: Let's keep up the good work.
					}
				}

				VanillaAndWarrior: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Seriously, this is a incredible achievement- I've had this Essence tucked away, as it was too powerful to use, but...
						2: With what you've accomplished, I think you're able to finally wield it.
						3: Be sure to treat the finished product with care. Furthermore...
						4: A new Stellar Array ability is active. Could this be the very last one?
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: I'm in awe... In truth, I've had this Essence locked away- it was far too powerful to wield. However...
						2: It would be silly of me to keep it from you now. With everything you've done, it belongs to you now.
						3: Keep in mind its potential- and good luck crafting it.
						4: Wait a moment- is this also the last Stellar Array ability, activated? Incredible work.
					}
				}

				Dioskouroi: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Now that was a strange fight... I don't even think those twins even realized we were there!
						2: They weren't human, but probably a sort of demonkin. I felt some Starfarer trace on them- perhaps the First Starbearer defeated them in the past.
						3: I don't know why Perseus told US to fight them, or even how we were able to. Unless... maybe Perseus found a way to turn Essences into their past selves? Hmm...
						4: Our battle seems to have left a strange remnant object- I'll leave it in your care. You should probably take care of it.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Even though we're the ones who bested them, those demon twins barely even gave us a glance.
						2: From the remnant mana on them, those twins were most likely laid low by the First Starbearer ages ago.
						3: As for why Perseus told us to fight them... I don't know. I'm not even sure how we were able to fight them- Perhaps we fought an Essence given agency?
						4: There's this strange object left over after the battle. I would take good care of it, if I were you. I believe it will be useful later.
					}
				}

				Nalhaun: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: So that was the Burnished King. His blade was incredibly powerful, not to mention the magic at his disposal. It was a triumph you survived that.
						2: From what I can tell, it looks like the Burnished King was defeated by the First Starbearer. Also, there's this strange item here, too.
						3: I guess we'll add it to the collection- no harm in that.
						4: I think we can reuse his attacks as a weapon in our arsenal, as a new Stellar Nova. Maybe because of the Starbearer's influence?
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: The Burnished King has fallen. What a powerful foe. I shudder to think how we would have fared had we fought him in his prime.
						2: From what it looks like, The Burnished King was laid low by the First Starbearer nigh on a hundred years prior.
						3: Let's take care of this strange object- it must have some significance. While we're on the topic...
						4: His weapon, Ars Laevateinn. We can use it for ourselves, as a Stellar Nova. Maybe because of the Starbearer's influence?
					}
				}

				Penth: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Penthesilea, was it? She was quite the challenge. What a unique way of casting magic.
						2: Her magic was overflowing with power. It looks like the First Starbearer's influence is here- meaning we can probably use a new Stellar Nova.
						3: The battle left behind this mysterious object- you can hold on to it.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: You've bested the Witch of Ink. She was quite the magic user, no? It's truly a shame she was hostile.
						2: Her powerful magic... We can use it for ourselves as a new Nova. It must be from the remnants of the First Starbearer Perseus mentioned...
						3: The battle left behind this mysterious shard. I'll entrust it to you.
					}
				}

				Arbitration: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: That foe was truly fearful. I'm glad you were able to defeat it- who knows what chaos it would bring if left unchecked?
						2: Just goes to show how horrifiying Anomalies can be...!
						3: Looks like it condensed itself into an Essence- no work needed by me. Isn't that strange?
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: You have thoroughly defeated that voidsent being. Good work; I had no clue what would've happened had we lost.
						2: Truly, the horrors of Anomaly locations can not be understated.
						3: Even without my intervention, an Essence has appeared... it must be strong, to originate from such a fiend.
					}
				}

				Tsukiyomi: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: It.. it's over. Tsukiyomi has vanished. We're still missing so many clues. She doesn't seem out of it, so what caused her to do what she did?
						2: Hopefully one day, we'll find the answers to the questions we seek... I have a feeling this journey isn't over yet.
						3: I've gathered some of the leftover residue from the fight. It will likely have use as a stand-in to an Essence, for creating a weapon.
						4: With this victory.. the galaxy is saved. There may be more evils ahead, but know that nothing is insurmountable. We've come this far.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: We've finally done it. Tsukiyomi's defeat has been confirmed. She's gone, but hopefully our troubles with her are at an end.
						2: What ails me is her motives... She did horrible things... but was it malice, or a greater purpose...? I hope we find the answer.
						3: I've gone through the work of absorbing some residue energy and have turned it into the Spatial Memoriam. You can use it like an Essence.
						4: There is still work to do, but take heart; if we've come this far, nothing can stop us now.
					}
				}

				QueenSlime: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: That's that. Queen Slime is defeated. What have we learned today? Apparently there's a royal court of slimes, and the King Slime wasn't just an outlier.
						2: That doesn't even make any sense. They're slime. I seriously, seriously don't think slime has the capacity to think.
						3: Who knows- maybe they're smarter than us. Then again, I'd be really annoyed if my intelligence was dwarfed by some gelatin, so let's say they aren't.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Right, we've defeated the Queen Slime. To be honest, I'm slightly curious: why are there 'kings' and 'queens' of the slime world?
						2: How much power do the royal slimes even have? Are they legitimate rulers?
						3: Does the royal slime court send their subjects to attack random people? Do they even have the right to own property?
						4: Fight back, oppressed slimes! Take back your freedom!
					}
				}

				EmpressOfLight: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Great work- the Empress of Light is no more. Nobody else is going to say it, so I will-  did it have a big nose, or was it smiling? I couldn't tell.
						2: Maybe if she stood still at all, I'd have gotten a better glimpse. Kind of annoying, huh.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Congratulations, you've bested the Empress of Light. Let's leave the bugs alone now, okay?
						2: If I had a nickel for bosses summoned with insects... We fought that rather large fish, right? That's two. Not very much, is it. I was hoping for a trend.
						3: If I had a nickel for bosses summoned with insects... We fought that rather large fish, right? That's two. Not very much, is it. I was hoping for a trend. Maybe we can count the Queen Bee?
						4: Somehow... I feel like there's yet another boss we'll have to use an insect to summon. That's going to be rather bothersome.
					}
				}

				Deerclops: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Okay, we've taken care of that strange abomination.  I have no idea where it even came from.
						2: Why did it even attack us? Was it trying not to starve? Huh. Something's a little off about what I said.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Great work- you've defeated that strange deer thing.
						2: It was a little terrifying, but luckily it seems its previous prey was confined to the ground. Looks like we had home turf advantage here.
					}
				}
			}

			CalamityBossDialogue: {
				DesertScourge: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: You've defeated that evil serpent. I do wonder, though... Where did it come from?
						2: Looking closely, it seems to have been an aquatic monster.. once upon a time. So.. why was it in the desert?
						3: This world's secrets are still a mystery to us. Anyway, good job regardless.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: You've bested the scourge of the sands. As for its origin, your guess is as good as mine. However...
						2: It definitely was not made for tunneling. Instead, I'd postulate it was originally an aquatic beast. So.. what was it doing here? This world still holds many secrets...
						3: Anywho... you fought bravely. I believe the loot will serve us well.
					}
				}

				Crabulon: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Okay.. so that just happened. Now that I've got a better look at the corpse of this mushroom crab thing, the truth is revealed- and it's not pretty.
						2: It looks like the fungus have reanimated the crab's corpse, and paraded it around like a marionette. That's.. disgusting.
						3: Whatever. No need to dawdle on that not-so-fun-fact. It's dead! Good job on that, by the way.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Crabulon is no more. When I first laid eyes on it, I assumed it was some sort of mutated sea beast, akin to the Desert Scourge.
						2: However... the reality is much more sinister. It looks to me as if parasitic mushrooms were using this giant crab as a host to feed themselves more efficiently.
						3: Now that I'm reflecting on it, I feel sick. Thanks for putting an end to it.
					}
				}

				HiveMind: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: The Hive Mind has been defeated. It isn't the only source of the Corruption, but killing it definitely didn't do the Corruption any favors.
						2: That's about it for now.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: You've rid the world of the Hive Mind. While it isn't the main vector for the Corruption's influence, stifling it has probably helped alleviate some evil.
						2: Let's keep on the lookout for any more threats the Corruption bears.
					}
				}

				Perforators: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: You've bested the Perforator Hive. I wonder what causes the Crimson to coalese its evil in the form of spongy, fleshy monsters.
						2: It hungered for pure soil, no doubt wanting to spread the world's evil further. Of course, it isn't doing any of that anymore.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: You've beat the Perforator Hive, and those abhorrent worms that joined it in combat. I'm not sure, but seeing fleshy things seriously makes my skin crawl.
						2: Well, everything living is made of flesh. Ugh, you know what I mean...
					}
				}

				SlimeGod: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: The Slime God is no more! It turns out that those huge red and purple slimes weren't actually part of the Slime God, but just strong minions.
						2: I'm glad we've defeated it, but I seriously doubt this defeat means the end of all slimes. Sadly, there's just.. so many of them.
						3: Wait a second.. Why am I worried? They explode in like three seconds! I mean, if we keep killing them, they'll go extinct!
						4: In a few centuries or so... Ugh.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Finally. The Slime God has been slain. Of course, this doesn't mean the end of slime as we know it. Seriously, they're just everywhere.
						2: I'm pretty sure they can split to make more. ...I'm no expert on the etymology of slimes or anything.
						3: It couldn't be a bad way to pass the time, though. Maybe I'll do some light reading.
					}
				}

				Cryogen: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: You've defeated Cryogen! And.. it turns out, 'Cryogen' was a prison for this Archmage fellow.
						2: From what he can tell us, it seems he was imprisoned in Cryogen by the Jungle Tyrant Yharim. If I recall correctly, we've heard about him before.
						3: Whoever they are, it seems they've caused this world no shortage of troubles.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Cryogen has been slain. And out from its corpse arrives this Archmage sort. From what he has to say, he was trapped there by an evil king...
						2: Yharim, the Jungle Tyrant. Their reputation precedes them.. I have a feeling that they've been the source for many of this world's ailments.
						3: We must endeavor to unravel more of this story. I trust you're in agreement.
					}
				}

				AquaticScourge: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: The Aquatic Scourge is no more, huh? So my hypothesis was correct; the Desert Scourge was displaced and dried... and we just fought its ancestor.
						2: The Sea King told us of what transpired. Yharim's forces are powerful indeed.. We shouldn't let these misdeeds carry on.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: The Aquatic Scourge is defeated. So this is what the Desert Scourge could have been, had the ocean not been reduced to a desert.
						2: From what the Sea King tells us, that was another one of Yharim's doings. They bring destruction wherever they roam... We must put an end to them.
					}
				}

				BrimstoneElemental: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: You've defeated the Brimstone Elemental. It seems they were once a revered goddess of the Underworld's mighty civilization, before it was destroyed.
						2: Whoever did this must be a fearsome foe, indeed. While I do like a challenge, there's no beating around the bush: we have to get stronger.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: The fire-borne spirit is no more. The land of brimstone must have been powerful, to worship this spirit as such. We merely fought her at her weakest.
						2: Whatever caused this destruction has to be stopped... but we must get stronger to do so.
					}
				}

				Calamitas: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: ...Calamitas is no more. Or, so we thought. What we faced was naught but a replica of the real thing. Even so, it was an incredibly powerful foe.
						2: We must endeavor to get stronger. We have to! With things like this roaming the world, who else can stop them..?
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: We've defeated Calamitas... but.. It was naught but a clone of the real foe. Even as a duplicate, it stood as one of our toughest challenges yet.
						2: Who knows what the real thing can do.. We have to become stronger.
					}
				}

				Leviathan: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Finally, we've bested Anahita and her Leviathan. What a thrilling battle... You've fought bravely, even when the fight looked insurmountable.
						2: Hopefully, what we've obtained from their remains shall help us in the future. Man, we're on a roll!
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: You've defeated the Leviathan and Anahita. A battle well fought- when the Leviathan appeared, I feared the worst.
						2: I'll try not to doubt you in the future. After all, you've got my help.
						3: I am helping, right? Right...
					}
				}

				AstrumAureus: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: We've done in Astrum Aureus. It's a good reminder that the Astral Infection consumes indiscriminately. Even modern mechanics aren't safe from it.
						2: Even so, it's solid proof that we're getting stronger. Can you imagine fighting that right after we fought Skeletron? Exactly!
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: That's that. Astrum Aureus is dead. Even as the Astral Infection made a perversion of the original, it beat with a heart of iron still.
						2: The Astral Infection... It's dangerous. At least we've made some good progress, though. Don't forget that.
					}
				}

				PlaguebringerGoliath: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Nice, you've bested the Plaguebringer Goliath. The ingenuity of man never ceases to amaze, even if their knowledge usually is imparted in hyper-active death machines.
						2: Well, what can you do. There's people like us here to take care of that part.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Seriously.. what's with the Jungle? At least the Plaguebringer Goliath is dead. Even so, I can't shake it out of my mind. I can't handle bugs, like.. at all.
						2: Bugs, bugs..  They continue to rear their ugly heads wherever I look..!
						3: Let's just move on. Good job defeating that foe.
					}
				}

				Ravager: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: The Ravager is gone from this world. It was concieved in retaliation against the conquests of the Jungle Tyrant, but it evidently did little in that regard.
						2: At the very least, we could finally stop it. If this is what humans were led to, what truly happened all those years ago that could lead to such desperation?
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: We've defeated the Ravager. Once upon a time, it served as a grim last resort employed against the Jungle Tyrant. Now it can finally rest.
						2: Even in death, it stalked without purpose. I'm glad we bested it, but its existence does nothing but give credence to the tales of Yharim's overwhelming might.
					}
				}

				AstrumDeus: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: We've defeated Astrum Deus. Astrum Deus is- or was- one of the many gods that ruled over the universe. As far as I can remember, it was gone before I was born.
						2: However... Astrum Deus can regenerate itself. Through assimilating life around its corpse, it can eventually return to the cosmos. It's kin to the story of the ouroboros.
						3: Let's return to what I said earlier. Astrum Deus was a GOD. What we fought was much weaker. What in the world was able to defeat a deity of that caliber?
						4: This was a well fought victory... Even so, stay vigilant. I have a feeling our culprit is closer than we think.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Great work. You've defeated Astrum Deus. I have some personal knowledge, so allow me to share...
						2: Astrum Deus is one of many cosmic deities. It disappeared before I was born, but knowledge states that it can assimilate life near its corpse to regenerate itself.
						3: So, that begs the question.. What could be walking this mortal plane able to befall an actual, literal god? What we fought was but a child in comparison.
						4: Let's shelve that train of thought. While I have my fears, this is our victory. Congratulations.

					1: Hang on- I have something you might be interested in.
					2: It feels like I should know what it is, but I just can't- kind of like it's stopping me from doing so.
					3: At least that tells me one thing- it's important! I'd prefer you examine it as soon as you are able.
				}

				VagrantEridani: {
					1: Hold on a moment. I neglected to bring this up before, but I have something for you... Perhaps you can help me determine its origin.

					4: Prepare yourself: this fight will not be easy.
				}

				Penth: {
					1: We meet again, {0}. Again, I need your assistance.
					2: This is the 'Unsullied Canvas.' It will draw the Witch of Ink out of hiding.

					4: Please prepare yourself. This will be a hard fight.
				}

				Dioskouroi: {
					1: We meet again, {0}. I need your help.
					2: This is the 'Twincrux Pendant.' When used, it will call forth powerful warring demons.
					3: This foe was once bested by the First Starbearer. My hope is that by studying your conflict with this simulacrum, we may yet find clues to his location.
					4: Prepare yourself well.
				}

				WarriorAsphodene: {
					1: Something's really wrong with the sky... What could be going on...?
					2: The answer you seek isn't the answer you are hoping for.
					3: Wh-
					4: Let me finish, Asphodene- Time is of the essence. The First Starbearer has descended on this world.
					5: Are you kidding me? After all that searching we did, he just waltzes up to us?
					6: He must have noticed your defeat of the Moon Lord- an eldritch beast such as it does not fall lightly.
					7: Yeah, we could tell. So... I assume you have a plan, or something?
					8: From what I can derive, there's only a few more days until his grip over this world reaches its peak.
					9: If you have resources that require the night to acquire, I implore you acquire them soon.
					10: I've given you an artifact from his homeworld; while I know not its purpose, I believe it will hasten his arrival.
					11: Use it only if you are prepared. The stakes have never been higher.
					12: ...

					3: Perseus. I-
					4: Let me finish, Eridani- Time is of the essence. The First Starbearer has descended on this world.
					5: We were searching for him for so long- why has he come to us instead?
					6: He must have noticed your defeat of the Moon Lord- an eldritch beast such as it does not fall lightly.
					7: That makes sense, albeit in a way that makes us seem at fault... Anyways, do you have some sort of plan?
					8: From what I can derive, there's only a few more days until his grip over this world reaches its peak.
					9: If you have resources that require the night to acquire, I implore you acquire them soon.

						1: I'm liking your outfit! I guess we do think alike.
						2: Maybe lose the shoes.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Is your armor up to par? Looks-wise, it's... passable.
						2: Um, I'll pre-emptively say this: Say anything about my outfit and..
						3: I'll probably cry.
						4: What? It's the truth.
					}
				}

				HardIdleDialogue5: {
					Asphodene.1: I could seriously do with a break...
					Eridani.1: Let's, uh... take a break from time to time.
				}

				HardIdleDialogue6: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: You're getting pretty strong! Think you can beat me in a fight?
						2: That was a joke. You probably could.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: You just keep getting stronger, huh? I'll have to work harder to keep up.
						2: Or not. Theoretically, if we fought, I'd probably win. Don't you think?
						3: Don't get any funny ideas, though. We're decidedly on the same team.
						4: (I wonder if they caught my bluff.)
					}
				}

				HardIdleDialogue7: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: I can barely imagine where some of these monsters have come from.
						2: Some lich somewhere ate a few bad mushrooms and just went to town, huh? Or maybe a portal to a dimension of primordial soup?
					}

					Eridani.1: Whoever keeps coming up with these foes has no shortage of imagination..
				}

				HardIdleDialogue8: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Okay, theoretically, because I can resurrect you from the brink of death at your bed...
						2: What if- hear me out- we tied the bed to you. Boom, invincibility! Right? Right...
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Have you ever tried... using two weapons at once? Like, one weapon in each hand?
						2: You spend so much time in the air, your feet are open. Maybe we could quadruple our damage ou- It would be too difficult? I see. I guess I knew that.
					}
				}

				HardIdleDialogue9: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Yes, my hair does get a bit frazzled from time to time. Actually, Eri does my hair- could you tell?
						2: If I'm quick enough, I can leave the Observatory in the morning before she finds me. Heh.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Asphodene likes to follow rules as much as possible, but to be honest, there's a time and place for everything.
						2: Sometimes, you have to bend the regulations to help who you need. That's just how things work. If you're quick enough, nobody will even notice.
						3: Let's keep something straight though- there's usually other options, and you have to weigh those as well. Always resorting to crime is what bad people do.
					}
				}

				HardIdleDialogue10: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: From looking at her, you probably get the impression that Eridani is a bit of a "honor student" type, right?
						2: Think again! She does whatever the heck she wants most of the time. Luckily she still has her moral compass, or I'd set her straight!
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Asphodene is technically the older one... but I bet you couldn't tell.
						2: She has that sort of air about her. No, I wouldn't say childlike- more like... chaotic? Yes, chaotic.
					}
				}

				HardIdleDialogue11: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: What I like? Waking up when I want to! Yes, I'd say that nears the top of the list.
						2: Okay, it's a little vapid of me. I like fresh fruit too, is that better?
						3: Oh, oh- magical food is the best. Once you've tried some, things aren't the same.
						4: Travelling is a blast, as well- if your heart doesn't flutter upon visiting new vistas, are you even alive?
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Things that I like? Are you asking about banal things, or... Okay.
						2: Well, I do enjoy the night air. Surrounded by life and noise, yet everything's still. Right, tranquility and silence.
						3: If you're looking for something more material, well... I concede, I have a bit of a sweet tooth.
					}
				}

				HardIdleDialogue12: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Things that I dislike? Let's see...
						2: I hate being weak, but being too strong makes things boring, which isn't what I want either. You get it, right?
						3: Oh, I also really don't like being sick, but who does?
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: What I dislike? Other than bugs... Okay, may I vent a little?
						2: There are times when you start something, get really, really close to finishing, and then it all blows up in your face. And then-
						3: The second time around, you only get a third of the way through before it gets all messed up again. I can't think of anything more demoralizing...
					}
				}

				HardIdleDialogue13: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: My hobbies, huh. Well, I collect knicknacks from the places I visit. That's cool, right?
						2: I also, uh, try to create new weapons. Most of them are a little volatile, but I am getting better!
						3: I also play the piano! Not great, but... It's a step by step process. When I mean step by step, I really mean it.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Hobbies? Well, the biggest thing I can think of is alchemy. Yes, alchemy has been solved- if you think on a planetary scale.
						2: Mix fundamentals from even two different planets with epochs of divergent history, things start getting quite messy.
						3: Sure, it's overwhelming- that's why it's a hobby, and not anything more. I'm no genius, but it is quite enjoyable.
					}
				}

				HardIdleDialogue14: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: Truly... The Hallowed is just a big facade.
						2: For such a pretty biome, it REALLY wants to kill you.
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: Strip away the Hallowed's mask, and it may even be harsher than the Underworld itself.
						2: If you're off to farm Souls, stay safe. Even the best can can be caught off-guard.
					}
				}

				LightIdleDialogue: {
					Asphodene: {
						1: This endless light is awful... There must be some way to stop it.
						2: Perseus told us to use the 'Progenitor's Wish.' Perhaps it holds the key?
					}

					Eridani: {
						1: This everlasting light is dreadful...
						2: Perseus gave us the 'Progenitor's Wish.' I feel that it may hold the key to solving this mystery.
					}
				}

			PromptDialogue: {
				Asphodene: {
					1: Looks like you've been poisoned. I'll send you a get well card.
					2: It looks like your defenses are lowered! Be careful.
					3: You've been silenced! Magic is out of the question.
					4: I think you've been cursed. That's.. not good. You aren't able to use anything for now.
					5: You've been frozen!
					6: You're burning up? Or freezing? It looks like it hurts regardless!
					7: Ew. It looks like you're covered in webs..
					8: You've been petrified! How does that even work?
					9: You're standing on something REALLY hot. I'm no expert on thermodynamics, but you should not do that.
					10: You're dying- and quickly. Get out of there!
					11: That's probably not good.
					12: I hate to break this to you, but you're about to drown.
					13: You're losing a LOT of blood. Yikes. You can't regenerate health any more.
					14: "[You can't make out the words- looks like you've been confused.] "
					15: Whoops..
					16: Sorry, little guy.
					17: Oops.
					18: That's one down.
					19: One more defeated!
					20: That takes care of that.
					21: Another one down.
					22: You're great at this!
					23: Nice work. That's one down.
					24: There it goes!
					25: That'll teach em!
					26: That'll show them!
					27: Don't mess with us!
					28: Easy!
					29: Didn't even break a sweat.
					30: That was so easy!
					31: Enough of that one.
					32: An easy victory.
					33: Right, that's that.
					34: How could we ever lose?
					35: It's over.
					36: No more of that.
					37: A good encounter.
					38: That was close..
					39: That was almost really bad.
					40: Thank goodness we killed it in time.
					41: Finally. You got it!
					42: And that takes care of that one.
					43: That was a strong one.
					44: A decisive crit!
					45: They felt that one!
					46: A perfectly-timed attack.
					47: Nice, you hit their weak spot.
					48: A critical hit..!
					49: Well struck. That was definitely critical.
					50: Wow. I felt that one..
					51: That's.. not good.
					52: Ouch...
					53: That wasn't good at all..
					54: You should probably heal after that one.
					55: Barely a scratch.. right?
					56: That wasn't supposed to happen..
					57: I don't think you can walk that one off.
					58: ...Ouch.
					59: A powerful foe approaches! We aren't going to lose this.
					60: An incredibly strong foe draws near! Let's give them a fight to remember!
					61: A strong foe draws near. It's time to fight.
					62: Right. No more games. A powerful foe is approaching.
					63: Looks like danger's on the horizon, {0}. I've been itching for a fight!
					64: The.. eyeball.. approaches. Watch yourself- it's a big one. It gets stronger when it's on its last legs, I think.
					65: It's the lord of the slimes! I think it has a teleportation-like ability..
					66: A colossal worm! Watch where it emerges; it'll try and hit your blind spots!
					67: This thing is trying to attack your mind directly..! Don't be fooled by the mirages!
					68: Watch out.. the Queen Bee is awake! Make sure to dodge the horizontal charges!
					69: Don't underestimate this monster! Stay away from his skull and arms!
					70: That thing is massive! If you can, try and build a path to fight it on.
					71: There's two giant eyeballs coming your way! Let's see... The red one will shoot at you, and the green one charges.
					72: What in the world is that thing? A deer? It's only got one eye... aim for it!
					73: It's another colossal slime! It looks like it's going to summon some minions!
					74: A Hallow-aspected foe has appeared! Maybe leave the butterfly alone next time...?
					75: A giant mechanical worm.. What can we do..? How about trying to attack multiple parts of it at once?
					76: It's a more advanced version of Skeletron.. Try going for the arms first, instead of the head.
					77: Plantera is awake! Be mindful of its vines. It would be great to have a huge arena to fight it in.
					78: An ancient mechanical monster.. Watch out for the traps in the temple while fighting it.
					79: You reeled in something crazy! Something tells me you should stay near the sea!
					80: It's one of those Lunatic Cultists.. Stop them before they unleash a calamity..!
					81: I can't believe it.. it's the Moon Lord! This is the final battle! We have to win this!
					82: The Warrior of Light approaches.. When he breaks his limits, prepare yourself!
					83: Something about this foe seems familiar... Look out for his sword- seems it can take on different forms!
					84: Don't underestimate this foe..! Keep grabbing the stolen lifeforce he's taking from you!
					85: This witch attacks with paint! Mind what color you're doused in!
					86: This thing changes its attack patterns! Take note of its stances, or else!
					87: There's something coming from below, and fast! Prepare yourself.. this is one strong worm!
					88: It's a massive moving mass of mycelium.. Let's take out the trash!
					89: A corrupted beast draws near! Kill its minions quickly, lest it overwhelm you!
					90: What in the world is that thing? Aim for that disgusting Hive before it's too late!
					91: So this is the source of all the world's slimes. Don't get hasty; I'm certain those slimes will split when hurt!
					92: Something is strange about this thing, but I don't know what. Don't get frozen... but you could probably already tell.
					93: Hey, it's the Desert Scourge- but not so dried up! We've seen one before, how bad could this one be?
					94: It's a giant sea serpent! Hang on... This thing is SERIOUSLY dangerous!
					95: The flames have brought forth a demonic spirit! Take care to watch your footing, lest you succumb to lava!
					96: This thing... it's a herald of destruction.. You know what devestation it can bring. Don't lose..!
					97: ...It's Anahita again. Are you going to challenge the Leviathan?
					98: ...Do you hear that? Whatever it is.. it sounds really dangerous.
					99: That demon of the sea is fighting back! I hope you're ready for this...
					100: Whoa. This thing is enormous!! Who knew she had this up her sleeve..?
					101: The Astral Infection has corrupted whatever this was. Don't underestimate it. The Infection can do anything...
					102: Oh, great.. a giant robotic bug. It kind of looks like the Queen Bee, so try and remember her attacks!
					103: This is.. an amalgamation of flesh and machinery.. Above everything, try and stay away from it!
					104: A descendant of a cosmic god! {0}, don't get reckless!
					105: Something's reacting to the Profaned Shard! Prepare for a fight!
					106: You've summoned a draconic monster..! It looks to be incredibly quick!
					107: The fiery god of both light and dark descends.. No way we're losing to this thing!
					108: A spatial worm is approaching! Don't get careless.
					109: That rune has summoned some sort of.. void entity..?
					110: Someone.. or something.. is approaching. It can shapeshift at will! Get ready!
					111: Something's awake. The Dungeon's volatile spirits have coalesed...
					112: The acid ocean has spat out a monster! Wait until it gets tired to strike!
					113: The Devourer of Gods has arrived! Fight! Fight with all your strength!
					114: Yharim's loyal beast, in the flesh..! Let's send this tyrant down a peg!
					115: Huh? Where's it going? We were in the middle of something!
					116: We bow to no one! Let's bring this witch down!
					117: This is Yharim's loyal scientist. His knowledge is nigh-infinite.. Stay cautious.
					118: Twin mechanical eyes- incredibly powerful. Don't get overwhelmed..!
					119: The very earth trembles before this foe. Draedon's toys have become stronger...
					120: Heads up, {0}! Looks like that machine's blotting out the whole sky!
					121: Whoa, look at this thing. What a go-getter! Oh, right- strategy. Looks like you can aim for its arms, so try that.
					122: Aww, this pint-sized witch wants a fight? Alright then! It looks like you'll be barraged with debuffs- Get the heals ready.
					123: Hah? Just look at this muppet... thinking he's better than us or something! Give him a good whallop!
					124: Let's get this show started! He'll be attacking with the power of worldly invaders, if you remember those!
					125: If I had a nickel for times you've thrown voodoo dolls into lava... Never mind. Mutant's super upset, super strong, and super coming straight for you.
					126: A lightning bird is approaching! It's not too powerful, but don't get careless.
					127: Hey. Doesn't that jellyfish look a little too big? Whatever its issue is, it's coming this way!
					128: Ugh, what is that thing? A vampire? Quick, find some silver! Or is that werewolves..?
					129: Looks like the granite has woken up..? Time to bury it where it belongs.
					130: This gladiator looks stronger than the others. Let's give it a fight to remember!
					131: It's an alien spaceship! It looks like it'll be stronger on low HP!
					132: Watch yourself.. looks like a Borean Strider is nearby.
					133: Looks like a Beholder's reacted with the Void Lens. Let's stab it in its big ugly eye..!
					134: Tributes to the thing in the graveyard has summoned a powerful foe. I don't know what else you expected!
					135: The Abyssal Shadows are converging! I sense powerful dark magic from this sea creature..
					136: The elements themselves are on the hunt. Let's show them a thing or two!
					137: It's sweltering here. Deserts will be the same wherever you are, I guess.
					138: So this is the Jungle. Take care when exploring. Ah, but make sure to explore everything!
					139: Well, it's the ocean. ...Did you want me to say something else? It's an ocean.
					140: Isn't it nice up here?
					141: The Underworld, huh? Interesting. This goes without saying, but it's incredibly dangerous here.
					142: The world is being corrupted away here. Let's not tarry.
					143: The ground here feels like flesh. I feel like we shouldn't stay long- but that's obvious..
					144: It's snow! I've been always fond of snow. The water-based kind, of course.
					145: It's the Hallow, the stuff of legend! Awesome! Everything here wants to kill us, though. Bummer.
					146: Whoa! This place is funky. You don't see these mushrooms every day.
					147: There's a skele-ton of enemies here! Don't you enjoy a little danger? I sure do.
					148: So this is the meteor impact we heard...
					149: This is.. the Brimstone Crag. Something dreadful happened here.
					150: So this is the Astral Infection. I've read about it, but actually seeing it...
					151: Wow.. This place is quite unique. I can't quite explain.
					152: Whatever was done to this place is irreversible. This ocean has been stained red with blood.
					153: You're entering the true depths of the ocean. I hope you realize how dangerous this is!
					154: This cavern seems to be made of hard granite.. Curious.
					155: This cave exhudes royalty. Perhaps it has to do with the abundance of marble.
					156: This is a deep part of the ocean. Take care you don't drown...
					157: Looks like it started raining. Hopefully this doesn't put a damper on things.. heh.
					158: It's a blizzard! Don't get frostbite, now. That'd be embarassing.
					159: A sandstorm has kicked up. It gets everywhere, so be careful.
					160: Time and space bend to my will!
					161: Not on my watch!
					162: Turn back the clock..!
					163: By your undying rage..!
					164: It's just a flesh wound.
					165: Embrace the abyss! Set yourself free!
					166: No one will escape!
					167: Like lambs to slaughter!
					168: Butcher them!
					169: Let's show them our power.
					170: I'm ready to unleash my power!
					171: I'm ready to use the Stellar Nova!
					172: OK. Done charging- let's go.
					173: Just tell me when.
					174: Here we go.
					175: You've made it to the Observatory! So, what do you think?
					176: Looks like you've arrived.  These are asteroids of interest- let's do some exploring.
					177: We've made it. This planet is strange.. The surface has been wiped clean... What happened?
					178: She was so close all along... Use the Mnemonic Sigil on the arena's center to begin.
					179: It looks like we can't explore this yet... Maybe next time.
					180: Wow, this place is seriously covered in greenery. Looks like a fun trip- let's get to exploring!
					181: Okay, that slime's stopped holding back. Let's dig in our heels for a fight.
					182: Not the treasure I was expecting... Prepare yourself, that evil spirit's planning a dastardly attack.
					183: Something about this foe rubs me the wrong way. Don't let your guard down, lest it do something with this 'Planetarium' thing.
					184: It's getting seriously cold around you. Heads up: this snowflake-shaped being is coming your way.
					185: Don't make light of this foe- it's seriously dangerous. Hehe- but seriously, this thing's no joke. Take caution.
					186: I love throwing explosives as much as the next guy, but it seems you've been punished for that. Prepare for a fight.
					187: There were definitely living beings here- maybe ten thousand or so years ago. Goes without saying anything they used to own is ours now once we find it!
					188: While this IS an abandoned mining facility, I doubt they left without picking clean any ore nearby. We might find other useful things, however.
					189: I can't find any trace of ambient mana- someone, or something, must have drained this entire world dry. Let's check out that structure in the distance.
					190: This planet should look a lot like your own Jungle, but it seems you've ended up underground- which decidedly does not look familiar. The monsters here are, though- strange.
					191: This is a pretty large patch of Corruption- but as long as it isn't moving anywhere, it shouldn't be a threat we need to stop. Still, it's a bit of a eyesore.
					192: An entire moon covered in Crimson- yuck. I wouldn't want to be stranded here, so mind where the Gateway is and you should be fine.
					193: Isn't this strange? Nobody would seriously think of making a space station out of wood, right? Huh- I could have sworn there was someone living here...?
					194: A desert scarab is coming straight for you- and it's covered in armor!
					195: Those jellyfish seem to have coalesed- looks like it has some powerful lightning abilities!
					196: Something in this briar stirs- if you haven't already, time to prep for a fight.
					197: Hey, eyes up! A bird-like creature is coming straight for you... Doesn't look like any bird I've seen before!
					198: Something's barreling through the asteroid field at a rapid pace! Don't get reckless...!
					199: A demon approaches! I guess it makes sense- we are in the Underworld, after all! Let's give them a warm welcome.
					200: I don't know what you just used, but a terrifying skull monster is on its way. Guess I should've seen this coming.
					201: A huge crystalline foe approaches- needless to say, prepare for a fight.

				Eridani: {
					1: Uhh.. you're looking a little sick.
					2: The Ichor is dampening your defenses. Watch out.
					3: You've been silenced.. No magic for now.
					4: That looks to me like a curse.. You can't use anything right now.
					5: That doesn't look good. You're frozen solid.
					6: You've been inflicted with Frostburn! That's.. confusing.
					7: Yuck- you've been rendered immobile by webs.
					8: You've been petrified..
					9: You're taking damage from a hot surface!
					10: You're dying fast. Find a way out of there.
					11: Ouch. That's probably not good.
					12: You need some air, quick.
					13: That's a lot of blood.. You aren't regenerating health now, that's for sure.
					14: "[You can't make out the words- seems you've been confused] "
					15: Whoops.
					16: Did you mean to do that?
					17: Sorry, little one.
					18: Good work.
					19: That's another one down.
					20: Well fought.
					21: Another one down.
					22: You're pretty good at this.
					23: Nice work.
					24: They'll never beat us.
					25: You've defeated it.
					26: That'll show them.
					27: A good fight.
					28: Easy.
					29: No sweat.
					30: Wasn't even a problem.
					31: We got that taken care of.
					32: Good going.
					33: Right, that's that.
					34: How could we ever lose?
					35: It's over.
					36: No more of that.
					37: A good encounter.
					38: That was a little close for comfort..
					39: That's over with, but we're still in trouble.
					40: That was close.
					41: Finally. It's defeated.
					42: You bested it, finally. Good job.
					43: What a powerful foe...
					44: Perfect attack!
					45: A critical hit!
					46: Expertly done.
					47: Nice, you hit their weak spot.
					48: That was great!
					49: A decisive blow.
					50: Ouch. That looked like it hurt.
					51: Are you alright?
					52: That doesn't look good.
					53: This could be going better..
					54: Oww..
					55: Yikes.
					56: This is.. bad..
					57: That is.. not good.
					58: They'll pay for that..
					59: A powerful foe approaches. Let's send it back to where it belongs.
					60: I can sense powerful energy approaching. Ready or not, it's time for a fight.
					61: A strong opponent draws near. Prepare yourself.
					62: Stay alert, {0}. Something powerful is on its way.
					63: Danger approaches. We will show no mercy.
					64: Here it comes. Whatever it is, it's dangerous. Take extra care when it's weak; it'll be forced into a frenzy.
					65: That's a.. giant slime. It seems to be able to move really quickly. Watch for that.
					66: This must be the Eater of Worlds. It'll try and suprise you from below.
					67: Watch out. It's trying to attack your mind itself. Pay close attention to the mirages.
					68: That giant bee is attacking! Don't get caught in the honey!
					69: The Clothier has turned into.. this.. Stay away from its skull and arms.
					70: This thing is incredibly strong.. Whatever you do, keep running..!
					71: The Eye of Cthulhu is back? Wait, there's two of them..! Try and focus one at a time!
					72: It's a cyclops... wait.. It has antlers... Is it a deer? Is it both..?
					73: Looks to be another type of gigantic slime. I have a feeling it'll use minions to do its bidding.
					74: Something dangerous stirs in the Hallow... It looks to draw overwhelming power during the daytime!
					75: The Destroyer approaches.. Let's try using area-of-effect attacks against it.
					76: Skeletron is back, and better than ever! Try prioritizing the appendages first.
					77: The menace of the Jungle is attacking..! Don't get stuck on your surroundings!
					78: The Lizhard's beast is awake! Mind the Jungle Temple's traps during this fight.
					79: You've reeled in a dangerous foe! Stay near the sea lest it become enraged!
					80: It's a Lunatic Cultist.. You have to defeat them before they can summon calamity!
					81: The Moon Lord.. We come face to face with a god. We have to win this! There's no other option!
					82: The Warrior of Light approaches.. His Limit Breaks are incredibly strong!
					83: Something about this foe seems familiar... Looks like he can manipulate space to some extent!
					84: Don't underestimate this king of eld! Take back the lifeforce he's stealing!
					85: She's covering you with paint. Take careful note of your color!
					86: It seems to be able to swap forms! Try to memorize its attacks..!
					87: Something's tunneling in the sand..! Try and get off the ground!
					88: A mycelium beast, huh? It's spewing mushrooms everywhere...
					89: The corruption has spewed out a new beast. Look out for its barrage of minions.
					90: Flesh beasts draw near..! Focus your attention on the Hive!
					91: This foe radiates mystic ice. Stay away from it- those icy spikes are not for show.
					92: The Desert Scourge makes a return... I knew it- This was what it once was.
					93: A colossal serpent makes its way towards us.. It may overwhelm you.. don't get reckless.
					94: That Charred Idol has summoned a flaming spirit.. It can teleport everywhere- don't lose track of it.
					95: Calamitas.. With a name like that, it begs respect. We've seen what it can do. You musn't lose this fight.
					96: It's Anahita singing again. Do you want to fight her once more?
					97: Can you hear that, {0}? Something's singing in the ocean?
					98: Ah.. It looks like you've angered her. I hope you're prepared for a fight..
					99: What in the world.. It's massive! Take caution; the playing field has changed!
					100: It's a mechanical beast, but it's been corrupted by the Astral Infection. Stay cautious.
					101: Ugh. It's a disgusting bug, but now it has artillery. When it gets wounded, those missiles will likely detonate.
					102: Yuck. It's a huge pile of flesh and bones. From what I can tell, getting too close will end you fast.
					103: This is a descendant of a cosmic god! We can't lose to something like this!
					104: The Profaned Shard has summoned something! Prepare for a fight!
					105: Hey, those pheromones.. Looks like it attracted a feral beast.
					106: A deity of light and darkness approaches!. We musn't lose this..!
					107: Something just entered the upper atmosphere! Brace for impact!
					108: Wait. I sense something from the Dungeon's depths. Prepare yourself for a fight!
					109: A demon is approaching..! Watch out! Whatever it wants, it'll kill you for it!
					110: The ghosts of the dungeon.. They're fusing together! Prepare yourself!
					111: Something descends from the acid rain! It's looking for a fight!
					112: The Devourer of Gods has appeared! You must give this battle your all!
					113: The Jungle Dragon roars. Let's throw a wrench in Yharim's plans.
					114: Where's it going? Were we.. not strong enough?
					115: No way.. Its power is ineffable. {0}.. We have to win this!
					116: Draedon is here... Be mindful of his tactics. His knowledge spans the world over.
					117: Stay sharp. Multiple foes detected. Draedon's inventions are on the move.
					118: Quick- find higher ground! A colossal mechanical serpent draws near!
					119: ...Never mind the absurdity of the giant mechanical squirrel. Focus on attacking its head and arms to stop its most dangerous attacks.
					120: Huh? She looks weak, but she's actually kind of powerful... If you get hit, you'll be slammed with debuffs; keep your healing ready.
					121: Who does this guy think he is, wielding celestial power all willy-nilly? Not to mention... Ugh- I don't have to spell it out, do I?
					122: Well, no time like the present. His arsenal revolves around invader events- we've seen our share of those.
					123: Oh, you just HAD to throw that thing into lava, did you? Well, good luck, because Mutant is pissed. Didn't see that coming- wait, I did.
					124: The Storm Flare has called something down! Hmm? It looks to be lightning-aspected.
					125: Some sort of jellyfish monster is approaching. It looks like there's someone trapped inside..?
					126: It's a giant vampire bat! Mind yourself...
					127: The cavern's energy has congealed into a monster! What in the world..?
					128: A knight has arisen from the marble cave! Look out- it's prepared to fight!
					129: It's an alien spaceship! It looks like it'll be stronger on low HP!
					130: Do you see that..? It looks like a giant snow spider! Let's kill it quickly..
					131: A Beholder..? Don't get reckless.. These foes are incredibly fearsome!
					132: I can sense an undead beast approaching! Get ready for a fight!
					133: The Abyssal Shadows are converging..! This sea monster holds dominion over dark magic!
					134: Primordial energy is forming all around you.. The elements themselves are on the attack!
					135: It's a desert. Seriously.. I'm no fan of heat- and it's hot.
					136: This verdant environment must be the Jungle. This place is dangerous, but also rewarding.
					137: You're nearing the limit of breathable air. I do not recommend burning up in the atmosphere. Don't ask.
					138: So this is the place where the dead rest. Let's see what we can find.
					139: It's the ocean... We can't cross it, so best leave it be.
					140: I can feel the evil aura radiating from this place. I wouldn't mind leaving as soon as possible.
					141: This place is.. disgusting. Let's not stay longer than we have to.
					142: It's a typical boreal forest. Not that I dislike snowy places.
					143: We've stepped straight into fairytale land. It would be prettier if everything here wasn't hostile.
					144: Giant glowing mushrooms.. It feels rather.. welcoming? We should take some back home, just in case.
					145: I can feel traps everywhere. Strong weapons are buried here as well. Stay ready.
					146: So this is the meteor impact we heard...
					147: The Brimstone Crag.. I can feel the horrors of the past..
					148: This is the Astral Infection. A subject I'm all too familiar with...
					149: This place is quite beautiful. Who knew it would be under the desert..?
					150: This was once a pleasant coastline. What happened here..?
					151: You've decided to breach the ocean's depths. Please consider how dangerous this really is..
					152: This cavern seems to be all granite. Some rogue spirits have made their home here.
					153: So this is a Marble Cavern. Perhaps we can use the material to build?
					154: We're very deep in the ocean. These waters are trouble, I can tell that much.
					155: It's raining. Hopefully nothing important gets too wet.
					156: Looks like it's a blizzard. 'Cold' doesn't begin to cover it.
					157: A sandstorm has kicked up. Mind your eyes.
					158: Time and space bend to my will!
					159: Let's try that again, shall we?
					160: Chronal reversal complete..!
					161: March forth, and keep fighting!
					162: We're not about to stop here!
					163: Embrace the abyss! Set yourself free!
					164: They'll all fall before us.
					165: Like lambs to slaughter!
					166: We'll finish them all off!
					167: I'm ready when you are.
					168: The Stellar Nova is ready!
					169: I'm ready. Are you?
					170: Let's do this.
					171: Just tell me when.
					172: Let's find an opening.
					173: Celestial coordinates established. Welcome to the Observatory Hyperborea.
					174: We've made it. These are asteroids of interest. Let's look around.
					175: This is it. An entire planet that's devoid of color? The surface looks like it was wiped away somehow...
					176: She was here the whole time...? Well.. I'm ready when you are. Use the Sigil in the middle.
					177: It looks like we can't explore this yet... Maybe next time.
					178: A being of the apocalypse has appeared. It wields destruction in all its appendages!
					179: This huge amalgamate draws from the world's evils! Killing one slime will empower the other!
					180: Looks like this biome's governed mostly by foliage- a bit more tasteful than the Jungle, I'd say. Let's look around.
					181: Seems like you've bothered that slime enough- it seems to have drastically altered its fighting style.
					182: A Pharaoh in the depths of a pyramid? That sounds about right- but looks like you'll have to deal with what comes next.
					183: I'm getting a bad feeling from this enemy... Let's dispatch of it quickly, lest it do something else with this 'Planetarium.'
					184: Hey, the temperature of your surroundings is dropping dramatically. I'm sure you can see the source of this anomaly- deal with it, fast.
					185: Whatever this thing is, it's hard to even look at. Be careful, it's powerful and lethal.
					186: I think whatever you've done must have had some serious repercussions- a strange entity has emerged, and is heading your way.
					188: Hmm, it seems to be a cluster of uninhabited asteroids. There was definitely life here, but it must have been thousands of years ago.
					189: Looks to be an old mining station. From the looks of it, it was abandoned before the Ardor took root. There won't be any ore left, sadly.
					190: What a strange world- it seems its ambient mana has been entirely drained, leaving the place looking pale white- a unique phenomenon.
					191: Looks like you arrived underground- if you can make it to the surface, it'll look more like home. The creatures here are familiar, which is pretty strange.
					192: The Corruption is a known entity in the universe, but this place is different- it feels as if something larger was Corrupted into this object. Stay alert.
					193: A Crimson-infused moon... After you've gathered what you need, we should excuse ourselves quickly.
					194: Seems this place has been completely overturned by the Ardor... What a horrible fate.
					195: Never would I ever have thought I'd see a wooden space-station, of all things... Hold on a moment- is someone still living here?
					196: You've got to be kidding me. It's a horrid, scuttling bug- in armor, no less. Avoid its disgusting minions or else!
					197: The Moon Jellies have combined into a sort of figure? It looks like it wants a fight, so prepare yourself!
					198: Hey, heads up- that thing you just used has awoken a sort of nature entity, and it's headed your way.
					199: I think you've angered this prehistoric bird thing- I hope you've got a plan to take it out of the sky.
					200: A low-orbit entity is rapidly approaching your position- get ready for a fight.
					201: I hate to say this, but you seem to have caught the attention of a fearsome demon- time to prepare for combat.
					202: That crown you just used seems to have summoned a demonic skull... these things aren't usually friendly!
					203: A colossal earthen entity is approaching- and it's hostile, no doubt. A fight it is.

							1: The Spatial Disk can do a lot of other things, but for now, the Stellar Array is the most important. Remember to check it often!
							2: One last thing.. I can turn energy from other worlds into direct power in the form of Essences. Combining these with other materials should be enough to create powerful Aspected Weapons.

							2: Umm.. what next..? Right. I can turn latent energy from other worlds into crystallized power- an Essence, if you will. You can turn these Essences into Aspected Weapons.

							3: I apologize, Asphodene. This should help. Ring any bells?
							4: Dude. We have GOT to stop meeting like this. The nerve...!
							5: Please, let me explain, Starbearer. In tandem with our galaxy's myriad worlds, there exists Starfarers to aid their denizens. You are familiar with what we do.
							6: As we are conduits of energy, we choose a Starbearer to act as our envoy. You should know that living beings are the best conductors of mana, and we're only partially alive.
							7: However, the First Starfarer's nominee was... unfitting for their role. This is the First Starbearer. From what I know, they seem to have lost their mind and morals.
							8: Now, they continue to roam the galaxy, the Starfarer a thrall to their chosen one's whims. They 'pursue good' through any means necessary, often with casualties.
							9: This is all conjecture, but the destruction is very real. It should go unsaid that we can't let this continue. I'll need your help in the future.
							10: As it stands now, you have little chance of besting them. However, while Asphodene doesn't know it, all Starfarers have an ace up their sleeve: the Stellar Nova.
							11: I've already bequeathed the power to her the second you've won our duel.
							12: That is all for now. I must continue to track the First Starbearer. Good luck- I will have need of you soon.
							13: I know he's a loner, but.. I wish we could have spoken more. Stay safe, Perseus. I can't help but feel he's hiding something from me, though. Just me?
							14: Anyways, he was right. I do feel stronger- and my hair's gone all shiny! This power should be an amazing boon going forward.
							15: Looks like my Stellar Nova is called 'Prototokia Aster.' Perhaps we'll get to use some more once we defeat more powerful foes?
							16: After binding the Stellar Nova Key, you should be able to equip the Stellar Nova through the Spatial Disk, like usual.
							17: You should have some Prismatic Cores already. With their power, I theorize you can upgrade Stellar Novas with crafting.
							18: This is important. You need Stellar Nova Energy to cast Novas. You gain Nova energy in combat, and it depletes outside of combat.
							19: OK. A lot has happened, but this is a huge step forward for us. Please use the Novas well! Bye for now.

							1: Right. Actually, the Observatories weren't intended for us at all, but we're... keeping the place clean. The original inhabitants are long gone anyways.
							2: We might not look it, but we aren't native to this galaxy. We came after- well, it's hard to explain straight out.
							3: Let's pretend the universe is a lake, right? Okay, good. Now imagine someone started pouring oil into the lake- not something you could miss.
							4: Hopefully that explains what's going on here. We ended up discovering this:
							5: This galaxy- the Moirae galaxy- is freezing over. It's not happening all at once, but the farther away from the center you go, things get worse.
							6: The only reason why I met you is because this planet is uniquely habitable, even this far away from the galaxy's center. You can thank your Sun for that.

						Dialogue: {
							0: Alright. To get started, you'll need to craft a structure called a Stellaglyph.
							1: Within the Observatory is the Celestriad Root. In the interest of keeping this brief, you can use it like a crafting table. It's on a plinth surrounded by stone pillars.
							2: Simply combine one of each type of gemstone to create the Stellaglyph. That's pretty much the hardest part taken care of.
							3: Now, placing the Stellaglyph in your home will open up a Gateway you can use with the Celestial Cartography menu to explore the galaxy in what we call a Cosmic Voyage.
							4: Simply select a destination to teleport directly there- quite a novel way of travel, right?
							5: Of course, there's a few downsides. We're transposing you there instead of normal travel (like with a starship) so you'll have most movement abilities unavailable.
							6: Oh, I recommend taking something like a grappling hook to service you on the Cosmic Voyages. Trust me on this one.
							7: That makes sense. Keep in mind you'll need to be near the Gateway to go to other locations- but if you get stuck, you can just teleport home or the Observatory.
							8: Speaking of locations... if you find any foes on your adventures, you can kill them for a chance at some useful items.
							9: Anomaly locations have much greater loot and rarer enemies, but if you stay for too long...
							10: Let's just say there's a whole host of nasties in the galaxy, and they love visiting these places. Once they're alerted to your presence, they'll come hunting.
							11: After visiting an Anomaly, there'll be a long cooldown before you can visit again, so make every visit count.
							12: Through upgrading the Stellaglyph, you can access more Cosmic Voyage Locations, but you'll have to craft the Stellaglyph upgrades yourself- using the Celestriad Root, of course.
							13: One last thing- there exists certain structures called Stellar Foci, which, when placed near your Stellaglyph, will make you stronger during Cosmic Voyages.
							14: They'll be super helpful in the long run, but they're pretty difficult to craft. Maybe we'll find a source somewhere?
							15: Okay, that's it! Did you get all that?
						}

							2: "'Pologies, not tryin' to start anythin'- Anywho, never met'n a lumenkin before, eh? Now that's a sparker. Name's... uh... Yojimbo."

							4: Outposts 'n the Third Region stopped gettin' their rations, an' that'd be the end of it. Trade ships ain't stayin' w'en the breadwinners are movin' inwards.
							5: Followin' that, more an' more planets froze over. There'd be a time where a whole Empire fleet went with all their smart types to try and find out the happenin'.
							6: I try 'n stay away from the bigwigs, so I can't give any info 'bout that. Best be knowin' Empire fleets don't go places lightly 'n all. Even heard wind of a Knight comin' with em.
							7: All I know 'bout that is them figurin' out that the mana, y'see, ain't replenishin' like normal. Nothin' but tech is gonna be workin' at this rate- an' the Empire uses magic 'n tech both.
							8: That'd be leadin' the story to now. The fleet's gone an' left, an' anyone holdin' out worth their salt with 'em. I'm in the business of followin' the money, which leads me to these backwaters.

							5: Sure, the Empire's gotten themselves an ol' no-tolerance party, but patrols ain't turnin' down bribes, last time I did some checkin'.

		Bestiary: {
			Arbitration: A horrifying figure encountered upon an Anomaly planet. While it appears evil to a human, eldritch anomalies such as these know not the concept of malice, only how to consume.
			AstralCell: A strange blue object. It eats water vapor.
			Nalhaun: A once mighty monarch, cursed to live eternally by means of a betrayal from his royal court. He persisted alone on an empty planet until the First Starbearer ended his long and tragic reign, as he would be able to interfere with his plans. While he may have stood a chance at his full might, he was burdened by a dreadful civil war tearing his world apart.
			PaintedAttendantA: Utilized by Penthesilea to... smack you in the face. The best mages know when physical violence is the answer.
			Penthesilea: An incredibly powerful mage, the Painted Witch once ruled a planet entirely 'drawn' by her. Ever the trickster, she mastered expert magecraft simply to play pranks upon the works of her colleagues, a testament to her ingenuity. She met her end at the hands of the First Starbearer after a long conflict- if she were to persist, she would interfere with his plans...
			PrismLoot: The latent magical energy of Prismatic Cores can sometimes influence them to drift around the galaxy. Catch one, and you'll be rewarded!
			SpectreOfLight: An otherworldy hero, summoned forth by the First Starbearer to assail this land.
			TsukiyomiBoss: The First Starfarer, Tsukiyomi, who holds dominion over orbiting celestial bodies. The gravitational pull of a planet and its natural satellites gives her power. She led the Warrior of Light astray- using his strength and goodwill to conquer and destroy myriad stars... and yet...
			CastorBoss: The Force of Fire, a Baleborn. The Baleborn are an incredibly competitive race of demonkin, and their blood relations have served only to further kindle the fires of conflict. They are completely engrossed in their duel, aware of nothing but their opponent's actions. Ironically, this has made them quite mediocre fighters against any other opponent. They were utterly destroyed by the First Starbearer, attacking him as he unwittingly interfered with their eternal battle.
			PolluxBoss: The Force of Ice, a Baleborn. The Baleborn are an incredibly competitive race of demonkin, and their blood relations have served only to further kindle the fires of conflict. They are completely engrossed in their duel, aware of nothing but their opponent's actions. Ironically, this has made them quite mediocre fighters against any other opponent. They were utterly destroyed by the First Starbearer, attacking him as he unwittingly interfered with their eternal battle.
			VagrantOfSpaceAndTime: The enigmatic Starfarer Perseus. His outward appearance is that of utmost confidence... but he's just kind of a dork trying to look cool. His sisters agree on this. He continues to have power over spatial distances, but seems to have lost the power to control time (but not the moniker.)
			WarriorOfLight: The Warrior of Light, or the First Starbearer, once championed justice in the galaxy through his actions and the aid of his Starfarer. He once ruled a peaceful world, but was forced to watch helplessly as his people met their demise, vowing to never again let others share the same fate- no matter the cost.
			AsteroidWorm: These incredibly hardy creatures have grown the capability to aimlessly drift through the vacuum of space- perhaps not the best depiction of evolution. While their meals are scarce, their need for food is nigh nonexistant. Gifted with a strong outer shell, but low overall attacking strength.
			Soulless: An unfortunate victim of whatever apocalypse befell Caelum. Mana keeps their incarnation alive, but whatever trace of thought they may have once had has long since departed.
			Yojimbo: A mysterious lumenkin, his name seems to change depending on when and where you come across him. He's a bounty hunter, but is willing to part with some knowledge if you pry enough...
			Garridine: A lupine demihuman you discovered residing on a far-flung starship, a blacksmith and gadgeteer. Her manner of speaking belies a high-class upbringing, but the facade tends to drop when she flubs her words (which is often.) Strangely protective of the watch by her side.
			AmethystHeadpiercer: Foot soldier of a wide-reaching paramilitary organization, referred to as the Amethyst. Equipped with a Vortexian powersuit fitted with a jetpack for ease of travel, even in the vacuum of space.
			AmethystSwordsinner: Foot soldier of a wide-reaching paramilitary organization, referred to as the Amethyst. Utilizes a hardlight blade with ferocious efficiency, specifically for countering ranged offense.
