            1: Here's another Essence you can use. It'll make a Ranged-type weapon with unique properties. Something tells me it's cursed, so..
            2: Good luck! I did warn you.
            3: Here is another Essence for you. This one's from a goddess of the Underworld, or so I'm told. It seems to be a melee weapon.
            4: Keep up the good work!
            5: Here is another Essence for you. Apparently, this originates from 'Midgard.' It looks to be a rather powerful melee weapon.
            6: That's it for now. Keep up the good work!
            7: Another Essence for you. This firey sword is classified as Magic. It seems to explode when sufficiently charged.
            8: I trust you'll know what to do.
            9: An Essence is here for your use. This powerful Melee heirloom is said to cleave the way for those less fortunate.
            10: Good luck in crafting it.
            11: This Essence is a personal creation of mine! It creates a Magic weapon that lets you enter the 'Butterfly Trance' and gain special bonuses!
            12: Please, use it if you can. I can always use more data!
            13: This Essence creates a Ranged gun that perpetuates itself after killing foes! Feel the heat!!
            14: Ahem. Please consider it in your arsenal.
            15: This Essence is a Ranged weapon that defeats foes with a swarm of powerful nanites. Truly fearful.
            16: If your gear supports it, try crafting this weapon!
            17: This Essence is another Ranged weapon that allows for powerful charged attacks. Fully charged, it splits and hits multiple foes!
            18: Hey. Aren't we getting too many Ranged weapons? I'll try and find something else next time.
            19: This is a legendary Melee artifact! The weapon this Essence crafts can inflict a crippling debuff on any foe!
            20: This Essence will create a support item this time. It'll give powerful buffs to you and your friends if you can keep it up.
            21: The Warrior of Light has inspired this Essence. It appears to be a key to a gateway of infinite weapons, doing Summon damage.
            22: If you feel inspired, try referring to your foes as mongrels.
            23: This Essence creates a Ranged weapon with a high Mana cost, and an incredibly high critical damage modifier.
            24: Exploitable? Surely. Theorycraft is all you.
            25: This is a Summon weapon. It seems to have very unique scaling properties, and attacks incredibly quickly.
            26: It's also a reflection of your heart... or something. I don't really get that stuff.
            27: This is a Summoner weapon, but you'll use it like a Melee weapon. It has the power to swap places instantly with a set place.
            28: While dangerous, it looks to be pretty powerful. Surely you won't get hit.. right?
            29: This is a pretty unique weapon. When using it, it'll follow-up your attacks, and become stronger when you spend Mana.
            30: This Essence hails from a world embroiled in conflict... It boasts incredible power, but if you get too overzealous, it'll start to hurt you.
            31: This Essence creates a Melee weapon that can swap between sword, scythe, or gun. You will be able to use it in nearly any situation!
            32: Okay, here's a new Essence for you. It's a huge Melee lance that can be swap between a lance form and a gun form. It looks to be pretty strong!
            33: Well {0}, take this Essence. This Melee weapon has an incredible burst, but the refractory period may be dangerous.. Give it a shot, though!
            34: Here's another Essence you can use! It has incredible synergy with Summons and gets stronger as you do, so if you plan on fighting with allies, this is it!
            35: Right, I have an Essence for you. It's a Summon weapon that conjures this mysterious sentient star. It's.. too cute. Anyways...
            36: It looks to be a powerful weapon, but you'll have to collect the Star Bits for full effect- meaning getting in the way of danger. Good luck..!
            37: Okay. I've got another Essence for you. This Melee weapon can swap between five different forms, granting powerful buffs in the process.
            38: Here's a Magic-type Essence. It'll make a scythe with incredible reach and balances between light and dark. Now THAT sounds cool. Right? Right.
            39: Here's another Essence for your use. This powerful Melee blade can deal powerful damage to all foes in your vicinity. How useful is that?
            40: Here's another Essence you can prepare to use, from Penthesilea's strength. With its magical paint, we should be able to best powerful foes.
            41: Here you go: an essence for usage in crafting. It looks like it'll apply powerful bouts of flame and frost alike. Not how I'd want to go out, personally.
            42: Whoa, this is a powerful Essence. It's potential seems to be magnified based on your Aspected Damage Type. How about giving it a go?
            43: Okay..! Time for another Essence! This looks to be a Ranged weapon with high damage output at close range.
            44: This new Essence is great! It's a Ranged weapon with crazy high explosive potential. Just point it towards the bad guys.
            45: I have a new Essence for you. This is a magical Summon-type weapon that seems to scale with your own potential. Interesting..!
            46: A Magic Essence is here this time. With cosmic energy, you can blast foes away with superpowered light. Sounds good to me!
            47: This Melee-type Essence should help. It looks to be a multiple-purpose power-suit with myriad attacks. Now that sounds cool!
            48: Okay {0}, I have an Essence for you! It seems to create a Magic-type weapon with powerful piercing damage... It sounds rather helpful.
            49: I've found another Essence you can use... I think. The only thing I can tell is that it makes a Ranged weapon. The rest is up to you.
            50: Okay- I've got it. Here's a Ranged-type Essence.. it looks to be something pretty powerful! Good luck.
            51: A Summon weapon's essence is here. It looks suspiciously like a whip... but it also can summon minions? Now that's peak.
            52: What? 'Peak?' It's new age lingo- You've definitely heard it before. You know? Like.. mountain peak? The top.. of something? Never mind.
            53: Okay- this is a Melee weapon! My instincts tell me it's perfect for high-defense foes. What are you waiting for?
            54: This Melee blade can harness the power of the elements themselves. Just having it in your hands is quite something!
            55: This looks to be a Magic weapon. With its power, you can call down entire stars to defeat your foes!
            56: You're worried you'll run out eventually? Yeah.. no.
            57: This looks to be... a Magic weapon. Strange- it feels like an entire armory is contained in this Essence. How's that possible?
            58: Well, I'll let you figure that one out. Get to it- I'm curious too, you know?
            59: Here's a Magic weapon for your usage. Looks to me like it's pretty complicated- you're up to the task though, right?
            60: Right.. Here's a Ranged-type weapon Essence.  I hope you've built up your chemical tolerance- it seems to utilize chemical energy to deal powerful damage.
            61: Behold- a new Essence! It's Melee damage this time. It has some incredible lifesteal powers- but also seems to drain your health on use? How about giving it a go?
            62: Here's a Summon weapon. It's.. Well, it's a whip, but it has some unique magical properties. It has good striking power, too!
            63: Listen close, {0}! Or not. This Magic weapon is a giant horn, but get this: you can whack people with it! Rad!
            64: Careful with this Essence- Apparently, only the worthy can wield it at full strength.
            65: An ancient civilization's magnum opus, it seems. Don't underestimate its destructive power.
            66: Look here, another Essence..! It's going to be Magic-type. It seems to revolve around balancing Black and White Mana to attack.
            67: It seems that they were opposites, at least where this thing came from. Makes you wonder...
            68: Thanks for waiting. Here's another Melee-type Essence for your use. While it's deceptively close-ranged, it has the potential for some crazy burst damage.
            69: Sure, it'll most likely burn you up from the inside. Just a little, though.
            70: Okay, here's an unorthodox Essence for you. While it functions as a pretty strong pickaxe, it looks like it also has some great damage potential.
            71: From my take, it seems to be a great off-hand weapon to pump out explosions. Everyone loves explosions, right?
            72: Here's a Ranged weapon- it has both a useful primary fire and can unleash strong self-sustaining drones to attack as well.
            73: I've got a new weapon for you: it's a powerful mid-range blade, with the ability to conjure a crystal which can alter your combat style. Interesting, huh?
            74: This is an Essence that'll turn into a pair of gloves. Now, I know what you're thinking, but let me explain.
            75: These gloves can conjure a whole arsenal of weapons for you to wield. Complicated, but it'll be very powerful if used right.
            76: Right. This Melee Essence dips into the void to defeat foes and absorb them after. Sounds pretty cool to me.
            77: I've acquired a new Essence for your use. It seems to borrow strength from Melee and Magic both- a versatile weapon, I like it!
            78: Looks like this Graveyard seems to have some connection to this Essence. Hopefully all these graves weren't just from you dying, right?
            79: Hmm... this Summon-type Essence will create some sort of controllable drone- I wonder if it can talk?
            80: This is certainly a Melee weapon- furthermore, it seems to be one that excels at a distance, as well as providing extra firepower in close combat. Nice.
            81: I plundered a Ranged-sort of essence from the likeness of those pirates. Sea... water... Actually, looks like I'm nearly dry with ocean jokes, so I'll anchor myself now.
            82: Well, I'm not sure what to make of this Essence, other than that it's a Summon weapon. Best you give it a go, before anything else goes haywire.
            83: This watch is a Summon-type weapon- looks like it'll call forth a cute time-aspected ally. She'll help with support if you can work with her combat style.
            84: Hmm... Perhaps you could even use it to dodge incoming attacks...?
            85: It looks to me like this Ranged-weapon has the ability to down hordes of foes pretty easily. Sounds like it'll come in handy- especially the giant coffin swings!

          }
          Eridani:
          {
            1: Here's a Ranged-type essence. It looks like every fourth shot has increased offensive properties. Whatever the reason, it's powerful.
            2: Here you are: another Essence. This one will create a Summon-type weapon. I trust you know what that means?
            3: I'm telling you to try it out.
            4: You knew that? Never mind then.
            5: I have quite the unique Essence for you. It looks to be a chainsaw imbued with the strength of a dog god.. Or so it seems.
            6: Whatever it may be, it should prove useful to you. Ignore the fact that it talks.
            7: I've gotten an Essence for you. This one will create a Magic-type weapon. Apparently, proper timing is needed to better utilize this weapon.
            8: I have no doubts you can get a handle on it easily. Okay, saying 'no doubts' would be a lie. Maybe 1/4th of a doubt.
            9: This Essence is used to craft an upgrade to Death in Four Acts. It will most likely boast incredible Ranged power.
            10: The weapon made from this Essence is based around music.. Timing your swings will be critical in using this to its fullest.
            11: Even holding it makes you feel a certain type of beat...
            12: This Essence will create a legendary weapon made for slaying dragons. Jump into the air and pierce your foes with its strength.
            13: It's a Melee weapon, so craft it if you can fit it in your arsenal.
            14: This Magic weapon will gain critical chance when shooting, and each crit will deal increased damage. It's powerful stuff.
            15: Consider it if you're able.
            16: This Ranged weapon allows you to enter a Melee stance, dealing more damage to foes you've hit with arrows. It should be quite engaging.
            17: This powerful Melee relic allows for the expidenture of Mana to teleport and deal powerful damage. It's a new favorite of mine.
            18: This weapon is made straight from the power of the Moon Lord and its spatial pillars. It'll do good in your hands.
            19: From the Warrior of Light.. this Essence allows for the usage of Limit Break. It's an incredibly strong Magic weapon.
            20: The Light will cleanse your sins! Or something like that.
            21: This weapon can switch between Ranged and Magic. If you time its reload correctly, it always does critical damage.
            22: I'm sure you can think of something that works around that...
            23: This powerful weapon allows you to use Skill Orbs to unleash special moves. It also has a super-powered burst window. It's a Melee weapon.
            24: You'd be well off with it in your hands.. but it does mean you have to get up close. I don't envy you.
            25: This is a Summon weapon. Holding it summons two cannons to orbit you, and you can fire from both of them. Each of them apply a different debuff.
            26: The important part is using the other weapon to trigger the other weapon's debuff. You can figure it out.
            27: Here's another Summon weapon. You can attack normally with it, but striking foes with the Timepieces empowers the weapon's attacks.
            28: Did I mention you can go back in time? It's powerful, for sure.
            29: This Essence allows for the creation of unique dual blades which offer varying effects, and allows you to leave your body to overwhelm foes.
            30: This Essence is utilized in the creation of a Melee Weapon. What sets it apart is the ability to manifest as a sword, scythe, or gun.
            31: Here's a new weapon for you to craft. This lance can swap between close and long range, and it can also be charged to great effect.
            32: This is for you, {0}. It's a super-powered Melee weapon that has an incredible burst phase, followed by a weakness phase. Good luck using it.
            33: I have another Essence for you. This weapon is a Summon weapon that works in harmony with minions, and it gets stronger as you do.
            34: I have another Essence for you to use. This Summon-type wand calls forth this adorable little sentient star, and it just looks so.. squishable..
            35: ...Looking past that. You'll have to get up close to use the Star Bits, but they do quite a number on foes if you can land them.
            36: I've given you another Essence. This is a Melee weapon that can morph between five different forms, changing the weapon's usage. Interesting.
            37: Here is another Essence. For you. This is a Summon weapon that will transform you as well as summon crystal shards that weaken and attack nearby foes.
            38: Hmm.. It's the Essence of Hope, but is there something else lurking beneath the surface? Who knows..
            39: Right... Here's another Essence. This Melee weapon allows you to damage all nearby foes in a huge area. It should be quite useful.
            40: This is another Essence you can master. It will allow you to use Penthesilea's ink to supress foes and strike bosses powerfully.
            41: Okay, I have another Essence for your battles. It summons a mystical fox that burns your enemies with icy energy. They might even deserve it, too.
            42: It looks like this next Essence is a strong one. Aspected Damage Type seems to empower the weapon further...
            43: I've located another Essence for your use. It seems this Ranged-type weapon is hyperfocused on movement. How about pairing it with some mobility tools..?
            44: Another Essence is yours. It's a strong Ranged weapon with incredibly good room-clearing power. How about that?
            45: Here's another Essence for you to use. It looks to be a Summon-type weapon that grows in strength with the use of more minion summons.
            46: Here's a Magic-type Essence. With the power of the stars, you can melt even the strongest of foes. Give it a try..?
            47: A Melee Essence is here this time. With its strength, you can create a multifaceted weapon that swaps its arsenal instantly in combat.
            48: I have an Essence for you, {0}. Looks like it'll become a Summon-type weapon... and it gains strength from grazing danger? You'll have to try it.
            49: This is another powerful Essence. Looks like it's a Melee weapon, and it has the potential to execute foes. Don't underestimate it.
            50: Time for another essence- this time it's a Ranged-type weapon. Seems to be pretty powerful at general destruction.
            51: Here's another weapon. Looks to be a summon-type whip that can deploy spider-robots to attack foes.
            52: They're spiders... but not real spiders. Yep- thinking like that will stop the fight or flight response. Take notes!
            53: This is a Melee weapon. It has pretty good anti-armor properties- you can definitely put that to good use.
            54: Another weapon is here. It seems to be a Melee weapon- one that uses the power of the elements to attack foes.
            55: This Magic-type staff will be incredibly helpful, if I do say so myself. It has the strength to conjure entire stars!
            56: As long as they aren't REAL stars. There would be... a few problems.
            57: Here's another weapon- Magic, it seems. There's something strange about it- this Essence seems to hold the strength of myriad weapons together.
            58: Here's another unique Magic weapon. Looks to be rather complicated, so good luck using it. Don't forget the ABCs- always be casting!
            59: Although, I'm not too sure that it applies here.
            60: This Essence sources a Ranged weapon. It has a high focus on tight mobility, meaning it'll put you into the front lines. The strength should compensate.
            61: A Melee-type Essence is prepared this time. It seems to me like it sacrifies your health for powerful area-of-effect damage. Use it well, but know the risks.
            62: Right, here's a Summon-type whip. It has some magic capability, but it's a bit random in its casting. Try and use it well.
            63: Be careful with this Essence- for some reason, it discharges static electricity all the time.
            64: It'll create a Summon weapon. Hopefully the electric properties carry over- it's sure to give our foes a shock.
            65: This Essence leads to a truly powerful weapon. It bears remnants of an ancient, advanced civilization.
            66: Evidently, they bore proficiency in spatial manipulation. I'd like you to give it a try, but it might reject the unworthy.
            67: At this point, I wonder if there was a weapon you weren't worthy to wield. Yes, I'm praising you.
            68: This Magic-type Essence balances attack and healing through the dual-use of Black and White mana.
            69: Two opposite schools of learning, at least in this Essence's original world. Now isn't that thought-provoking.
            70: Apologies for the delay- here's an Essence. This Melee weapon has some recoil potential, but in exchange you could deal some explosive amounts of damage.
            71: I'd ask you to use it in moderation, but I'm sure you'll use it as much as you like. Bring some healing potions, at the very least.
            72: This Essence focuses on excavation as well as damage. You can use it to move earth at significant rates, and additionally deal powerful explosive damage.
            73: Here's a Ranged weapon- it has both a useful primary fire and can unleash strong self-sustaining drones to attack as well.
            74: I've a new Celestial weapon for your use. It'll be more powerful when you utilize its strength to summon a Prismic, which can assist you in battle.
            75: Here's a new weapon for your use. In truth, this Essence is a bit more than that; it's a pair of gloves.
            76: Of course, that's not the whole story- you can use these gloves to summon an entire arsenal of weapons.
            77: I know the prospect sounds daunting, but you'll deal some heavy damage if you can manage the weapons well.
            78: Okay, here's a Melee weapon- with the power of souls, you can cleave huge areas around you and dip into the void itself for instant teleportation.
            79: Looks to be a new Essence for your use. It uses a unique damage type and powerful charge attacks- but it'll probably have some recoil damage.
            80: This Graveyard seems to have connected to this Essence. I hope it'll help you avoid creating the Graveyard in the first place.
            81: While powerful, I believe it's a utility item, and not a weapon this time.
            82: This Magic Essence, while aspected to nature, seems rather volatile. Perhaps you'd be able to better use it in tandem with other weapons?
            83: This Melee weapon harnesses an aspect of time itself to help you in combat. It seems to have some impressive range, as well.
            84: How about it; that previous... um, let's say 'get-together' with those pirates has churned up an Essence- Ranged damage, from what I can tell. Here you are.
            85: I'm not sure how to define this Summon-type Essence, so I'll leave it as an exercise for you. Well... good luck.
            86: This Summon-type weapon conjures a rather charming time-aspected being. She'll help with both offensive and defensive duties.
            87: This essence is a Ranged-type weapon, but it seems to have a lot of close-ranged action. Don't get overzealous, but do try to make the most of it.
          }
          Perseus:
          {

              3: Did anyone else see that ninja thing? Was it just me?
              4: Somehow.. it was strong enough to unlock a part of the Stellar Array! Check it out later, OK?

              3: Something about this foe has unlocked a part of the Stellar Array. Perhaps it was fiercer than usual?

              3: Just to let you know, there's another upgrade in the Stellar Array now. It seems to be more powerful than the ones you've used before.
              4: Also, it seems to have dropped something.. Whatever it is, it feels.. familiar. Please be careful, but I can't deny I'm curious.

            72: What in the world is that thing? A deer? It's only got one eye... aim for it!
            73: It's another colossal slime! It looks like it's going to summon some minions!
            74: A Hallow-aspected foe has appeared! Maybe leave the butterfly alone next time...?
            75: A giant mechanical worm.. What can we do..? How about trying to attack multiple parts of it at once?
            76: It's a more advanced version of Skeletron.. Try going for the arms first, instead of the head.
            77: Plantera is awake! Be mindful of its vines. It would be great to have a huge arena to fight it in.
            78: An ancient mechanical monster.. Watch out for the traps in the temple while fighting it.
            79: You reeled in something crazy! Something tells me you should stay near the sea!

            83: Something about this foe seems familiar... Look out for his sword- seems it can take on different forms!
            84: Don't underestimate this foe..! Keep grabbing the stolen lifeforce he's taking from you!
            85: This witch attacks with paint! Mind what color you're doused in!
            86: This thing changes its attack patterns! Take note of its stances, or else!
            87: There's something coming from below, and fast! Prepare yourself.. this is one strong worm!
            88: It's a massive moving mass of mycelium.. Let's take out the trash!
            89: A corrupted beast draws near! Kill its minions quickly, lest it overwhelm you!
            90: What in the world is that thing? Aim for that disgusting Hive before it's too late!
            91: So this is the source of all the world's slimes. Don't get hasty; I'm certain those slimes will split when hurt!
            92: Something is strange about this thing, but I don't know what. Don't get frozen... but you could probably already tell.
            93: Hey, it's the Desert Scourge- but not so dried up! We've seen one before, how bad could this one be?
            94: It's a giant sea serpent! Hang on... This thing is SERIOUSLY dangerous!
            95: The flames have brought forth a demonic spirit! Take care to watch your footing, lest you succumb to lava!
            96: This thing... it's a herald of destruction.. You know what devestation it can bring. Don't lose..!
            97: ...It's Anahita again. Are you going to challenge the Leviathan?
            98: ...Do you hear that? Whatever it is.. it sounds really dangerous.
            99: That demon of the sea is fighting back! I hope you're ready for this...
            100: Whoa. This thing is enormous!! Who knew she had this up her sleeve..?
            101: The Astral Infection has corrupted whatever this was. Don't underestimate it. The Infection can do anything...
            102: Oh, great.. a giant robotic bug. It kind of looks like the Queen Bee, so try and remember her attacks!
            103: This is.. an amalgamation of flesh and machinery.. Above everything, try and stay away from it!
            104: A descendant of a cosmic god! {0}, don't get reckless!
            105: Something's reacting to the Profaned Shard! Prepare for a fight!
            106: You've summoned a draconic monster..! It looks to be incredibly quick!
            107: The fiery god of both light and dark descends.. No way we're losing to this thing!
            108: A spatial worm is approaching! Don't get careless.
            109: That rune has summoned some sort of.. void entity..?
            110: Someone.. or something.. is approaching. It can shapeshift at will! Get ready!
            111: Something's awake. The Dungeon's volatile spirits have coalesed...
            112: The acid ocean has spat out a monster! Wait until it gets tired to strike!
            113: The Devourer of Gods has arrived! Fight! Fight with all your strength!
            114: Yharim's loyal beast, in the flesh..! Let's send this tyrant down a peg!
            115: Huh? Where's it going? We were in the middle of something!
            116: We bow to no one! Let's bring this witch down!
            117: This is Yharim's loyal scientist. His knowledge is nigh-infinite.. Stay cautious.
            118: Twin mechanical eyes- incredibly powerful. Don't get overwhelmed..!
            119: The very earth trembles before this foe. Draedon's toys have become stronger...
            120: Heads up, {0}! Looks like that machine's blotting out the whole sky!
            121: Whoa, look at this thing. What a go-getter! Oh, right- strategy. Looks like you can aim for its arms, so try that.
            122: Aww, this pint-sized witch wants a fight? Alright then! It looks like you'll be barraged with debuffs- Get the heals ready.
            123: Hah? Just look at this muppet... thinking he's better than us or something! Give him a good whallop!
            124: Let's get this show started! He'll be attacking with the power of worldly invaders, if you remember those!
            125: If I had a nickel for times you've thrown voodoo dolls into lava... Never mind. Mutant's super upset, super strong, and super coming straight for you.
            126: A lightning bird is approaching! It's not too powerful, but don't get careless.
            127: Hey. Doesn't that jellyfish look a little too big? Whatever its issue is, it's coming this way!
            128: Ugh, what is that thing? A vampire? Quick, find some silver! Or is that werewolves..?
            129: Looks like the granite has woken up..? Time to bury it where it belongs.
            130: This gladiator looks stronger than the others. Let's give it a fight to remember!
            131: It's an alien spaceship! It looks like it'll be stronger on low HP!
            132: Watch yourself.. looks like a Borean Strider is nearby.
            133: Looks like a Beholder's reacted with the Void Lens. Let's stab it in its big ugly eye..!
            134: Tributes to the thing in the graveyard has summoned a powerful foe. I don't know what else you expected!
            135: The Abyssal Shadows are converging! I sense powerful dark magic from this sea creature..
            136: The elements themselves are on the hunt. Let's show them a thing or two!
            137: It's sweltering here. Deserts will be the same wherever you are, I guess.
            138: So this is the Jungle. Take care when exploring. Ah, but make sure to explore everything!
            139: Well, it's the ocean. ...Did you want me to say something else? It's an ocean.
            140: Isn't it nice up here?
            141: The Underworld, huh? Interesting. This goes without saying, but it's incredibly dangerous here.
            142: The world is being corrupted away here. Let's not tarry.
            143: The ground here feels like flesh. I feel like we shouldn't stay long- but that's obvious..
            144: It's snow! I've been always fond of snow. The water-based kind, of course.
            145: It's the Hallow, the stuff of legend! Awesome! Everything here wants to kill us, though. Bummer.
            146: Whoa! This place is funky. You don't see these mushrooms every day.
            147: There's a skele-ton of enemies here! Don't you enjoy a little danger? I sure do.
            148: So this is the meteor impact we heard. I bet we can make some crazy stuff with a meteorite.
            149: This is.. the Brimstone Crag. Something dreadful happened here.
            150: So this is the Astral Infection. I've read about it, but actually seeing it...
            151: Wow.. This place is quite unique. I can't quite explain.
            152: Whatever was done to this place is irreversible. This ocean has been stained red with blood.
            153: You're entering the true depths of the ocean. I hope you realize how dangerous this is!
            154: This cavern seems to be made of hard granite.. Curious.
            155: This cave exhudes royalty. Perhaps it has to do with the abundance of marble.
            156: This is a deep part of the ocean. Take care you don't drown...
            157: Looks like it started raining. Hopefully this doesn't put a damper on things.. heh.
            158: It's a blizzard! Don't get frostbite, now. That'd be embarassing.
            159: A sandstorm has kicked up. It gets everywhere, so be careful.
            160: Time and space bend to my will!
            161: Not on my watch!
            162: Turn back the clock..!
            163: By your undying rage..!
            164: It's just a flesh wound.
            165: Embrace the abyss! Set yourself free!
            166: No one will escape!
            167: Like lambs to slaughter!
            168: Butcher them!
            169: Let's show them our power.
            170: I'm ready to unleash my power!
            171: I'm ready to use the Stellar Nova!
            172: OK. Done charging- let's go.
            173: Just tell me when.
            174: Here we go.
            175: You've made it to the Observatory! So, what do you think?
            176: Looks like you've arrived.  These are asteroids of interest- let's do some exploring.
            177: We've made it. This planet is strange.. The surface has been wiped clean... What happened?
            178: She was so close all along... Use the Mnemonic Sigil on the arena's center to begin.
            179: It looks like we can't explore this yet... Maybe next time.
            180: Wow, this place is seriously covered in greenery. Looks like a fun trip- let's get to exploring!
            181: Okay, that slime's stopped holding back. Let's dig in our heels for a fight.
            182: Not the treasure I was expecting... Prepare yourself, that evil spirit's planning a dastardly attack.
            183: Something about this foe rubs me the wrong way. Don't let your guard down, lest it do something with this 'Planetarium' thing.
            184: It's getting seriously cold around you. Heads up: this snowflake-shaped being is coming your way.
            185: Don't make light of this foe- it's seriously dangerous. Hehe- but seriously, this thing's no joke. Take caution.
            186: I love throwing explosives as much as the next guy, but it seems you've been punished for that. Prepare for a fight.
            187: There were definitely living beings here- maybe ten thousand or so years ago. Goes without saying anything they used to own is ours now once we find it!
            188: While this IS an abandoned mining facility, I doubt they left without picking clean any ore nearby. We might find other useful things, however.
            189: I can't find any trace of ambient mana- someone, or something, must have drained this entire world dry. Let's check out that structure in the distance.
            190: This planet should look a lot like your own Jungle, but it seems you've ended up underground- which decidedly does not look familiar. The monsters here are, though- strange.
            191: This is a pretty large patch of Corruption- but as long as it isn't moving anywhere, it shouldn't be a threat we need to stop. Still, it's a bit of a eyesore.
            192: An entire moon covered in Crimson- yuck. I wouldn't want to be stranded here, so mind where the Gateway is and you should be fine.
            193: Isn't this strange? Nobody would seriously think of making a space station out of wood, right? Huh- I could have sworn there was someone living here...?
          }
          Eridani:
          {
            1: Uhh.. you're looking a little sick.
            2: The Ichor is dampening your defenses. Watch out.
            3: You've been silenced.. No magic for now.
            4: That looks to me like a curse.. You can't use anything right now.
            5: That doesn't look good. You're frozen solid.
            6: You've been inflicted with Frostburn! That's.. confusing.
            7: Yuck- you've been rendered immobile by webs.
            8: You've been petrified..
            9: You're taking damage from a hot surface!
            10: You're dying fast. Find a way out of there.
            11: Ouch. That's probably not good.
            12: You need some air, quick.
            13: That's a lot of blood.. You aren't regenerating health now, that's for sure.
            14: "[You can't make out the words- seems you've been confused] "
            15: Whoops.
            16: Did you mean to do that?
            17: Sorry, little one.
            18: Good work.
            19: That's another one down.
            20: Well fought.
            21: Another one down.
            22: You're pretty good at this.
            23: Nice work.
            24: They'll never beat us.
            25: You've defeated it.
            26: That'll show them.
            27: A good fight.
            28: Easy.
            29: No sweat.
            30: Wasn't even a problem.
            31: We got that taken care of.
            32: Good going.
            33: Right, that's that.
            34: How could we ever lose?
            35: It's over.
            36: No more of that.
            37: A good encounter.
            38: That was a little close for comfort..
            39: That's over with, but we're still in trouble.
            40: That was close.
            41: Finally. It's defeated.
            42: You bested it, finally. Good job.
            43: What a powerful foe...
            44: Perfect attack!
            45: A critical hit!
            46: Expertly done.
            47: Nice, you hit their weak spot.
            48: That was great!
            49: A decisive blow.
            50: Ouch. That looked like it hurt.
            51: Are you alright?
            52: That doesn't look good.
            53: This could be going better..
            54: Oww..
            55: Yikes.
            56: This is.. bad..
            57: That is.. not good.
            58: They'll pay for that..
            59: A powerful foe approaches. Let's send it back to where it belongs.
            60: I can sense powerful energy approaching. Ready or not, it's time for a fight.
            61: A strong opponent draws near. Prepare yourself.
            62: Stay alert, {0}. Something powerful is on its way.
            63: Danger approaches. We will show no mercy.
            64: Here it comes. Whatever it is, it's dangerous. Take extra care when it's weak; it'll be forced into a frenzy.
            65: That's a.. giant slime. It seems to be able to move really quickly. Watch for that.
            66: This must be the Eater of Worlds. It'll try and suprise you from below.
            67: Watch out. It's trying to attack your mind itself. Pay close attention to the mirages.
            68: That giant bee is attacking! Don't get caught in the honey!
            69: The Clothier has turned into.. this.. Stay away from its skull and arms.
            70: This thing is incredibly strong.. Whatever you do, keep running..!
            71: The Eye of Cthulhu is back? Wait, there's two of them..! Try and focus one at a time!
            72: It's a cyclops... wait.. It has antlers... Is it a deer? Is it both..?
            73: Looks to be another type of gigantic slime. I have a feeling it'll use minions to do its bidding.
            74: Something dangerous stirs in the Hallow... It looks to draw overwhelming power during the daytime!
            75: The Destroyer approaches.. Let's try using area-of-effect attacks against it.
            76: Skeletron is back, and better than ever! Try prioritizing the appendages first.
            77: The menace of the Jungle is attacking..! Don't get stuck on your surroundings!
            78: The Lizhard's beast is awake! Mind the Jungle Temple's traps during this fight.
            79: You've reeled in a dangerous foe! Stay near the sea lest it become enraged!
            80: It's a Lunatic Cultist.. You have to defeat them before they can summon calamity!
            81: The Moon Lord.. We come face to face with a god. We have to win this! There's no other option!
            82: The Warrior of Light approaches.. His Limit Breaks are incredibly strong!
            83: Something about this foe seems familiar... Looks like he can manipulate space to some extent!
            84: Don't underestimate this king of eld! Take back the lifeforce he's stealing!
            85: She's covering you with paint. Take careful note of your color!
            86: It seems to be able to swap forms! Try to memorize its attacks..!
            87: Something's tunneling in the sand..! Try and get off the ground!
            88: A mycelium beast, huh? It's spewing mushrooms everywhere...
            89: The corruption has spewed out a new beast. Look out for its barrage of minions.
            90: Flesh beasts draw near..! Focus your attention on the Hive!
            91: This foe radiates mystic ice. Stay away from it- those icy spikes are not for show.
            92: The Desert Scourge makes a return... I knew it- This was what it once was.
            93: A colossal serpent makes its way towards us.. It may overwhelm you.. don't get reckless.
            94: That Charred Idol has summoned a flaming spirit.. It can teleport everywhere- don't lose track of it.
            95: Calamitas.. With a name like that, it begs respect. We've seen what it can do. You musn't lose this fight.
            96: It's Anahita singing again. Do you want to fight her once more?
            97: Can you hear that, {0}? Something's singing in the ocean?
            98: Ah.. It looks like you've angered her. I hope you're prepared for a fight..
            99: What in the world.. It's massive! Take caution; the playing field has changed!
            100: It's a mechanical beast, but it's been corrupted by the Astral Infection. Stay cautious.
            101: Ugh. It's a disgusting bug, but now it has artillery. When it gets wounded, those missiles will likely detonate.
            102: Yuck. It's a huge pile of flesh and bones. From what I can tell, getting too close will end you fast.
            103: This is a descendant of a cosmic god! We can't lose to something like this!
            104: The Profaned Shard has summoned something! Prepare for a fight!
            105: Hey, those pheromones.. Looks like it attracted a feral beast.
            106: A deity of light and darkness approaches!. We musn't lose this..!
            107: Something just entered the upper atmosphere! Brace for impact!
            108: Wait. I sense something from the Dungeon's depths. Prepare yourself for a fight!
            109: A demon is approaching..! Watch out! Whatever it wants, it'll kill you for it!
            110: The ghosts of the dungeon.. They're fusing together! Prepare yourself!
            111: Something descends from the acid rain! It's looking for a fight!
            112: The Devourer of Gods has appeared! You must give this battle your all!
            113: The Jungle Dragon roars. Let's throw a wrench in Yharim's plans.
            114: Where's it going? Were we.. not strong enough?
            115: No way.. Its power is ineffable. {0}.. We have to win this!
            116: Draedon is here... Be mindful of his tactics. His knowledge spans the world over.
            117: Stay sharp. Multiple foes detected. Draedon's inventions are on the move.
            118: Quick- find higher ground! A colossal mechanical serpent draws near!
            119: ...Never mind the absurdity of the giant mechanical squirrel. Focus on attacking its head and arms to stop its most dangerous attacks.
            120: Huh? She looks weak, but she's actually kind of powerful... If you get hit, you'll be slammed with debuffs; keep your healing ready.
            121: Who does this guy think he is, wielding celestial power all willy-nilly? Not to mention... Ugh- I don't have to spell it out, do I?
            122: Well, no time like the present. His arsenal revolves around invader events- we've seen our share of those.
            123: Oh, you just HAD to throw that thing into lava, did you? Well, good luck, because Mutant is pissed. Didn't see that coming- wait, I did.
            124: The Storm Flare has called something down! Hmm? It looks to be lightning-aspected.
            125: Some sort of jellyfish monster is approaching. It looks like there's someone trapped inside..?
            126: It's a giant vampire bat! Mind yourself...
            127: The cavern's energy has congealed into a monster! What in the world..?
            128: A knight has arisen from the marble cave! Look out- it's prepared to fight!
            129: It's an alien spaceship! It looks like it'll be stronger on low HP!
            130: Do you see that..? It looks like a giant snow spider! Let's kill it quickly..
            131: A Beholder..? Don't get reckless.. These foes are incredibly fearsome!
            132: I can sense an undead beast approaching! Get ready for a fight!
            133: The Abyssal Shadows are converging..! This sea monster holds dominion over dark magic!
            134: Primordial energy is forming all around you.. The elements themselves are on the attack!
            135: It's a desert. Seriously.. I'm no fan of heat- and it's hot.
            136: This verdant environment must be the Jungle. This place is dangerous, but also rewarding.
            137: You're nearing the limit of breathable air. I do not recommend burning up in the atmosphere. Don't ask.
            138: So this is the place where the dead rest. Let's see what we can find.
            139: It's the ocean... We can't cross it, so best leave it be.
            140: I can feel the evil aura radiating from this place. I wouldn't mind leaving as soon as possible.
            141: This place is.. disgusting. Let's not stay longer than we have to.
            142: It's a typical boreal forest. Not that I dislike snowy places.
            143: We've stepped straight into fairytale land. It would be prettier if everything here wasn't hostile.
            144: Giant glowing mushrooms.. It feels rather.. welcoming? We should take some back home, just in case.
            145: I can feel traps everywhere. Strong weapons are buried here as well. Stay ready.
            146: So this is the meteor impact we heard. Wonder what you can make out of it..?
            147: The Brimstone Crag.. I can feel the horrors of the past..
            148: This is the Astral Infection. A subject I'm all too familiar with...
            149: This place is quite beautiful. Who knew it would be under the desert..?
            150: This was once a pleasant coastline. What happened here..?
            151: You've decided to breach the ocean's depths. Please consider how dangerous this really is..
            152: This cavern seems to be all granite. Some rogue spirits have made their home here.
            153: So this is a Marble Cavern. Perhaps we can use the material to build?
            154: We're very deep in the ocean. These waters are trouble, I can tell that much.
            155: It's raining. Hopefully nothing important gets too wet.
            156: Looks like it's a blizzard. 'Cold' doesn't begin to cover it.
            157: A sandstorm has kicked up. Mind your eyes.
            158: Time and space bend to my will!
            159: Let's try that again, shall we?
            160: Chronal reversal complete..!
            161: March forth, and keep fighting!
            162: We're not about to stop here!
            163: Embrace the abyss! Set yourself free!
            164: They'll all fall before us.
            165: Like lambs to slaughter!
            166: We'll finish them all off!
            167: I'm ready when you are.
            168: The Stellar Nova is ready!
            169: I'm ready. Are you?
            170: Let's do this.
            171: Just tell me when.
            172: Let's find an opening.
            173: Celestial coordinates established. Welcome to the Observatory Hyperborea.
            174: We've made it. These are asteroids of interest. Let's look around.
            175: This is it. An entire planet that's devoid of color? The surface looks like it was wiped away somehow...
            176: She was here the whole time...? Well.. I'm ready when you are. Use the Sigil in the middle.
            177: It looks like we can't explore this yet... Maybe next time.
            178: A being of the apocalypse has appeared. It wields destruction in all its appendages!
            179: This huge amalgamate draws from the world's evils! Killing one slime will empower the other!
            180: Looks like this biome's governed mostly by foliage- a bit more tasteful than the Jungle, I'd say. Let's look around.
            181: Seems like you've bothered that slime enough- it seems to have drastically altered its fighting style.
            182: A Pharaoh in the depths of a pyramid? That sounds about right- but looks like you'll have to deal with what comes next.
            183: I'm getting a bad feeling from this enemy... Let's dispatch of it quickly, lest it do something else with this 'Planetarium.'
            184: Hey, the temperature of your surroundings is dropping dramatically. I'm sure you can see the source of this anomaly- deal with it, fast.
            185: Whatever this thing is, it's hard to even look at. Be careful, it's powerful and lethal.
            186: I think whatever you've done must have had some serious repercussions- a strange entity has emerged, and is heading your way.
            188: Hmm, it seems to be a cluster of uninhabited asteroids. There was definitely life here, but it must have been thousands of years ago.
            189: Looks to be an old mining station. From the looks of it, it was abandoned before the Ardor took root. There won't be any ore left, sadly.
            190: What a strange world- it seems its ambient mana has been entirely drained, leaving the place looking pale white- a unique phenomenon.
            191: Looks like you arrived underground- if you can make it to the surface, it'll look more like home. The creatures here are familiar, which is pretty strange.
            192: The Corruption is a known entity in the universe, but this place is different- it feels as if something larger was Corrupted into this object. Stay alert.
            193: A Crimson-infused moon... After you've gathered what you need, we should excuse ourselves quickly.
            194: Seems this place has been completely overturned by the Ardor... What a horrible fate.
            195: Never would I ever have thought I'd see a wooden space-station, of all things... Hold on a moment- is someone still living here?

                2: One last thing.. I can turn energy from other worlds into direct power in the form of Essences. Combining these with other materials should be enough to create powerful Aspected Weapons.

                1: The Spatial Disk has plenty of other uses, but by my hypothesis we don't have access to them yet. Hopefully, as we get stronger, more facets of the Disk will open up to us.
                2: Umm.. what next..? Right. I can turn latent energy from other worlds into crystallized power- an Essence, if you will. You can turn these Essences into Aspected Weapons.

                3: I apologize, Asphodene. This should help. Ring any bells?
                4: Dude. We have GOT to stop meeting like this. The nerve...!
                5: Please, let me explain, Starbearer. In tandem with our galaxy's myriad worlds, there exists Starfarers to aid their denizens. You are familiar with what we do.
                6: As we are conduits of energy, we choose a Starbearer to act as our envoy. You should know that living beings are the best conductors of mana, and we're only partially alive.
                7: However, the First Starfarer's nominee was... unfitting for their role. This is the First Starbearer. From what I know, they seem to have lost their mind and morals.
                8: Now, they continue to roam the galaxy, the Starfarer a thrall to their chosen one's whims. They 'pursue good' through any means necessary, often with casualties.
                9: This is all conjecture, but the destruction is very real. It should go unsaid that we can't let this continue. I'll need your help in the future.
                10: As it stands now, you have little chance of besting them. However, while Asphodene doesn't know it, all Starfarers have an ace up their sleeve: the Stellar Nova.
                11: I've already bequeathed the power to her the second you've won our duel.
                12: That is all for now. I must continue to track the First Starbearer. Good luck- I will have need of you soon.
                13: I know he's a loner, but.. I wish we could have spoken more. Stay safe, Perseus. I can't help but feel he's hiding something from me, though. Just me?
                14: Anyways, he was right. I do feel stronger- and my hair's gone all shiny! This power should be an amazing boon going forward.
                15: Looks like my Stellar Nova is called 'Theofania Inanis.' Perhaps we'll get to use some more once we defeat more powerful foes?
                16: After binding the Stellar Nova Key, you should be able to equip the Stellar Nova through the Spatial Disk, like usual.
                17: You should have some Prismatic Cores already. With their power, I theorize you can upgrade Stellar Novas with crafting.
                18: This is important. You need Stellar Nova Energy to cast Novas. You gain Nova energy in combat, and it depletes outside of combat.
                19: OK. A lot has happened, but this is a huge step forward for us. Please use the Novas well! Bye for now.

                6: The only reason why I met you is because this planet is uniquely habitable, even this far away from the galaxy's center. You can thank your Sun for that.

              {
                0: Alright. To get started, you'll need to craft a structure called a Stellaglyph.
                1: Within the Observatory is the Celestriad Root. In the interest of keeping this brief, you can use it like a crafting table. It's on a plinth surrounded by stone pillars.
                2: Simply combine one of each type of gemstone to create the Stellaglyph. That's pretty much the hardest part taken care of.
                3: Now, placing the Stellaglyph in your home will open up a Gateway you can use with the Celestial Cartography menu to explore the galaxy in what we call a Cosmic Voyage.
                4: Simply select a destination to teleport directly there- quite a novel way of travel, right?
                5: Of course, there's a few downsides. We're transposing you there instead of normal travel (like with a starship) so you'll have most movement abilities unavailable.
                6: Oh, I recommend taking something like a grappling hook to service you on the Cosmic Voyages. Trust me on this one.
                7: That makes sense. Keep in mind you'll need to be near the Gateway to go to other locations- but if you get stuck, you can just teleport home or the Observatory.
                8: Speaking of locations... any loot you find won't be replenished when you visit again, except for Anomalies.
                9: Anomaly locations have much greater loot and rarer enemies, but if you stay for too long...
                10: Let's just say there's a whole host of nasties in the galaxy, and they love visiting these places. Once they're alerted to your presence, they'll come hunting.
                11: After visiting an Anomaly, there'll be a long cooldown before you can visit again, so make every visit count.
                12: Through upgrading the Stellaglyph, you can access more Cosmic Voyage Locations, but you'll have to craft the Stellaglyph upgrades yourself- using the Celestriad Root, of course.
                13: One last thing- there exists certain structures called Stellar Foci, which, when placed near your Stellaglyph, will make you stronger during Cosmic Voyages.
                14: They'll be super helpful in the long run, but they're pretty difficult to craft. Maybe we'll find a source somewhere?
                15: Okay, that's it! Did you get all that?

                7: All I know 'bout that is them figurin' out that the mana, y'see, ain't replenishin' like normal. Nothin' but tech is gonna be workin' at this rate- an' the Empire uses magic 'n tech both.
                8: That'd be leadin' the story to now. The fleet's gone an' left, an' anyone holdin' out worth their salt with 'em. I'm in the business of followin' the money, which leads me to these backwaters.

Striking foes with Theofania Inanis will inflict Void Atrophy, dealing powerful damage over time. The second cast of Theofania Inanis will double the potency of Void Atrophy, if applicable.

You will be unable to execute the counterattack if the foe is further than melee range, but damage will still be negated. You will be refunded 50% of the Stellar Nova energy cost if you are not hit during Kiwami Ryuken.

          Additionally, your next attack will become [c/B703FF:Driving Thunder]
          [c/B703FF:Driving Thunder] will sweep in a wide arc, dealing high amounts of damage
          If [c/B703FF:Driving Thunder] defeats an opponent, the mana used for placing the [c/CB8EE3:Lightning Stiletto] will be refunded
          If you attempt to teleport to an unaccessable location, you will consume the [c/CB8EE3:Lightning Stiletto] without teleporting but still prepare [c/B703FF:Driving Thunder]
          'Woven from lightning itself, from a land where gods roam free'

      RecipeConditions: {}
      Bestiary:
      {
        Arbitration: A horrifying figure encountered upon an Anomaly planet. While it appears evil to a human, eldritch anomalies such as these know not the concept of malice, only how to consume.
        AstralCell: A strange blue object. It eats water vapor.
        Nalhaun: A once mighty monarch, cursed to live eternally even as his kingdom crumbed around him. The ability to conjure forth powerful monsters was gifted to him by his final retainer ere she breathed her last. He persisted alone on an empty planet until the First Starbearer ended his long and tragic reign.
        PaintedAttendantA: Utilized by Penthesilea to... smack you in the face. The best mages know when physical violence is the answer.
        Penthesilea: An incredibly powerful mage, the Painted Witch once ruled a planet entirely 'drawn' by her. Ever the trickster, she mastered expert magecraft simply to play pranks upon the works of her colleagues, a testament to her ingenuity. She met her end at the hands of the First Starbearer after a long conflict.
        PrismLoot: The latent magical energy of Prismatic Cores can sometimes influence them to drift around the galaxy. Catch one, and you'll be rewarded!
        SpectreOfLight: An otherworldy hero, summoned forth by the First Starbearer to assail this land.
        Tsukiyomi2: The First Starfarer, Tsukiyomi, who holds dominion over orbiting celestial bodies. The gravitational pull of a planet and its natural satellites gives her power. She led the Warrior of Light astray- using his strength and goodwill to conquer and destroy myriad stars... and yet...
        VagrantOfSpaceAndTime: The enigmatic Starfarer Perseus. His outward appearance is that of utmost confidence... but he's just kind of a dork trying to look cool. His sisters agree on this. He continues to have power over spatial distances, but seems to have lost the power to control time (but not the moniker.)
        WarriorOfLight: The Warrior of Light, or the First Starbearer, once championed justice in the galaxy through his actions and the aid of his Starfarer. He once ruled a peaceful world, but was forced to watch helplessly as his people met their demise, vowing to never again let others share the same fate- no matter the cost.
        AsteroidWorm: These incredibly hardy creatures have grown the capability to aimlessly drift through the vacuum of space- perhaps not the best depiction of evolution. While their meals are scarce, their need for food is nigh nonexistant. Gifted with a strong outer shell, but low overall attacking strength.
        Soulless: An unfortunate victim of whatever apocalypse befell Caelum. Mana keeps their incarnation alive, but whatever trace of thought they may have once had has long since departed.
        Yojimbo: A mysterious lumenkin, his name seems to change depending on when and where you come across him. He's a bounty hunter, but is willing to part with some knowledge if you pry enough...
        Garridine: A lupine demihuman you discovered residing on a far-flung starship, a blacksmith and gadgeteer. Her manner of speaking belies a high-class upbringing, but the facade tends to drop when she flubs her words (which is often.)
        AmethystHeadpiercer: Foot soldier of a wide-reaching paramilitary organization, referred to as the Amethyst. Equipped with a Vortexian powersuit fitted with a jetpack for ease of travel, even in the vacuum of space.
        AmethystSwordsinner: Foot soldier of a wide-reaching paramilitary organization, referred to as the Amethyst. Utilizes a hardlight blade with ferocious efficiency, specifically for countering ranged offense.
