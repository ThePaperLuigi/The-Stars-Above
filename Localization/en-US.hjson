			Garridine.1: You needn't have come all this way- a letter would have sufficed. Hmm, how would the letter arrive? I see.

			Astrologian: {
				WizardDialogue: I'm not sure what to think of {0}. They're obviously a cosplayer- you'd expect them to know no magic... and yet..!
				FirstDialogue: Salulations, friend. My collection magecraft has led me to you- I see you've found a celestial relic. If you are willing to part with some coin, a portion of my collection can be yours- or, I can also sell you the means to utilize it.
				StandardDialogue1: I think I'm going broke.
				StandardDialogue2: Looks like today's going to be bad luck. Or is it good luck? If only I had a better view.
				StandardDialogue3: You want to know more information about Starfarers? They're a known phenomenon, but most of their impact is consigned to history books. In fact, it's strange you ask.
				StandardDialogue4: Astrology extends far beyond star signs and constellations. To an extent, you must have ample magical knowledge and scientific expertise.
				StandardDialogue5: I collect and categorize celestial relics. You most likely are not interested in the majority of them.
				StandardDialogue6: Yes, things are expensive- that's just how it is. How am I to buy anything?
				BloodMoon: Hmm, a strange celestial body seems to be affecting our moon. What a pain.
				Party: Yeah, right. I'm not going outside, but I will partake in the food.
				Graveyard: Where in the world is all this accursed fog coming from?
				StrangePotion: Strange Potion
				ThespianNotReadyCorruption: I have something you may be interested in, but you must prepare better. How about dealing with the issues in the Corruption first?
				ThespianNotReadyCrimson: I have something you may be interested in, but you must prepare better. How about dealing with the issues in the Crimson first?
				ThespianReady: Here's something you might take interest with: this potion has a magical trace I've never once encountered before- very powerful. It does no good languishing in my stockpile, so take it before I change my mind.
				RareDialogue1: Haha, you say I resemble other members of my profession? Have you ever considered... they're also me?
				RareDialogue2: Have you guessed? Yes, I'm faekin- a faerie. No, I don't do magic tricks.
				AstralDialogue: I can sense the Astral Aspect upon you- if you were not aware, 'aspect' is a misnomer. In fact, being Astral aspected is more of a polarity. How you are aspected itself is a wonder... You must be hiding something.
				UmbralDialogue: I can sense the Umbral Aspect upon you- if you were not aware, 'aspect' is a misnomer. In fact, being Umbral aspected is more of a polarity. How you are aspected itself is a wonder... You must be hiding something.

					152: Whatever was done to this place is irreversible. This ocean has been stained red with blood.
					153: You're entering the true depths of the ocean. I hope you realize how dangerous this is!
					154: This cavern seems to be made of hard granite.. Curious.
					155: This cave exhudes royalty. Perhaps it has to do with the abundance of marble.
					156: This is a deep part of the ocean. Take care you don't drown...
					157: Looks like it started raining. Hopefully this doesn't put a damper on things.. heh.
					158: It's a blizzard! Don't get frostbite, now. That'd be embarassing.
					159: A sandstorm has kicked up. It gets everywhere, so be careful.
					160: Time and space bend to my will!
					161: Not on my watch!
					162: Turn back the clock..!
					163: By your undying rage..!
					164: It's just a flesh wound.
					165: Embrace the abyss! Set yourself free!
					166: No one will escape!
					167: Like lambs to slaughter!
					168: Butcher them!
					169: Let's show them our power.
					170: I'm ready to unleash my power!
					171: I'm ready to use the Stellar Nova!
					172: OK. Done charging- let's go.
					173: Just tell me when.
					174: Here we go.
					175: You've made it to the Observatory! So, what do you think?
					176: Looks like you've arrived.  These are asteroids of interest- let's do some exploring.
					177: We've made it. This planet is strange.. The surface has been wiped clean... What happened?
					178: What is this place?
					179: It looks like we can't explore this yet... Maybe next time.
					180: Wow, this place is seriously covered in greenery. Looks like a fun trip- let's get to exploring!
					181: Okay, that slime's stopped holding back. Let's dig in our heels for a fight.
					182: Not the treasure I was expecting... Prepare yourself, that evil spirit's planning a dastardly attack.
					183: Something about this foe rubs me the wrong way. Don't let your guard down, lest it do something with this 'Planetarium' thing.
					184: It's getting seriously cold around you. Heads up: this snowflake-shaped being is coming your way.
					185: Don't make light of this foe- it's seriously dangerous. Hehe- but seriously, this thing's no joke. Take caution.
					186: I love throwing explosives as much as the next guy, but it seems you've been punished for that. Prepare for a fight.
					187: There were definitely living beings here- maybe ten thousand or so years ago. Goes without saying anything they used to own is ours now once we find it!
					188: While this IS an abandoned mining facility, I doubt they left without picking clean any ore nearby. We might find other useful things, however.
					189: I can't find any trace of ambient mana- someone, or something, must have drained this entire world dry. Let's check out that structure in the distance.
					190: This planet should look a lot like your own Jungle, but it seems you've ended up underground- which decidedly does not look familiar. The monsters here are, though- strange.
					191: This is a pretty large patch of Corruption- but as long as it isn't moving anywhere, it shouldn't be a threat we need to stop. Still, it's a bit of a eyesore.
					192: An entire moon covered in Crimson- yuck. I wouldn't want to be stranded here, so mind where the Gateway is and you should be fine.
					193: Isn't this strange? Nobody would seriously think of making a space station out of wood, right? Huh- I could have sworn there was someone living here...?
					194: A desert scarab is coming straight for you- and it's covered in armor!
					195: Those jellyfish seem to have coalesed- looks like it has some powerful lightning abilities!
					196: Something in this briar stirs- if you haven't already, time to prep for a fight.
					197: Hey, eyes up! A bird-like creature is coming straight for you... Doesn't look like any bird I've seen before!
					198: Something's barreling through the asteroid field at a rapid pace! Don't get reckless...!
					199: A demon approaches! I guess it makes sense- we are in the Underworld, after all! Let's give them a warm welcome.
					200: I don't know what you just used, but a terrifying skull monster is on its way. Guess I should've seen this coming.
					201: A huge crystalline foe approaches- needless to say, prepare for a fight.
					202: Ack; looks like that potion did do something. Don't let your guard down.
					203: Get ready, because I won't hold back!
					204: What IS that thing?! A being of pure void energy...
					205: It's even stronger now?! Hey, isn't this, like... really bad?
					206: You're kidding me.
					207: Well, let's show 'em what we can do.
					208: You've attracted that squid! So... what now? Beat it up, I guess?
					209: So this is that sentinel, huh? Looks pretty tough!
					210: I wonder what we'll find?
					211: This place certainly is interesting!
					212: Looks like a new locale to explore!
					213: Something new on the horizon.
					214: Seems to me we've stumbled across something new.
					215: What is this place?
					216: (Laugh)
					217: The sky's so bright... This can't be good!
					218: Rain again, huh?
					219: Looks like it's starting to rain.
					220: That was amazing! You didn't even get hit at all!
					221: That was close! At least we won in the end.
					222: Phew! In the end, victory is all that matters.
					//Mod: Fargo's Souls:
					//CursedCoffin
					223: Can't say I didn't see this coming... Pyramids are always riddled with curses.
					//BanishedBaron
					224: Ugh, this thing won't let you leave the water... Don't lose sight of it.
					//Lifelight
					225: ...That's no pixie... Looks like we have a fight on our hands!
					//Mod of Redemption
					//Thorn
					226: That cursed thing... it's made up of thorns! Don't get caught in its brambles!
					//Erhan
					227: This was definitely a bad idea. Mayhaps I should have spoken up when you used the FORBIDDEN RITUAL- if it wasn't clear enough?!
					//TheKeeper
					228: What is this fiend's problem? ...Somehow, I feel like we can help them- at least, I think.
					//SeedofInfection
					229: Whatever this thing is, you need to get rid of it immediately. It looks like it'll spread and never stop!
					//KingSlayerIII
					230: Well, you've ticked them off- I'd try to pierce that bubble somehow... perhaps with close-ranged damage?
					//1stOmegaPrototype
					231: Now that's a big sword!! Ah, right- If you get struck, I recommend a brief retreat- it looks to be able to hinder your movement somehow.
					//2ndOmegaPrototype
					232: This seems a bit excessive... Alright, let's give it our best shot. Focus on those shield cores the boss uses; that seems like a natural weakness.
					//3rdOmegaPrototype
					233: Okay, surely this is the last of these things, right? What does 'prepare for obliteration' even mean?
					//PatientZero
					234: This huge xenomite thing is dangerous- don't take it lightly. Whatever it is, prepare for a tough fight.
					//AncientDiety
					235: Why is it raining all of a sudden? Wait, keep your guard up- this isn't like before!
					//Nebuleus
					236: That Galaxy Stone is resonating with someone from beyond the sky- I hope this was worth it...
					//SirNautilus
					237: Alright, a duel it is! Let's give it our all.

						2: Uhh, I swear you were standing right there. Wait, don't tell me that stone statue is YOU.

					}

					onFire: {
						1: Ouch. That's probably not good.
						2: So, your body temperature is around 300 degrees above normal. You're probably aware, though...

					15: Was that truly necessary?
					16: An ambush!? That's cheating!
					17: That was a part of the plan, right?
					18: Good work.
					19: Nothing else nearby. You can take a rest now.
					20: Well fought.
					21: That should be all of them.
					22: You're pretty good at this.
					23: Nice work. No nearby foes detected.
					24: Seems to be all of them. Good work.
					25: Looks like that's the lot of them.
					26: That'll show them.
					27: A good fight.
					28: You fought well. Let's keep up the pace.
					29: That's all of them. Onto the next...
					30: Wasn't even a problem for you, huh? Great, let's keep it up.
					31: We got that taken care of.
					32: Good going.
					33: Right, that's that. Onwards we go.
					34: How could we ever lose?
					35: It's over. Let's make up for lost time.
					36: No more of that- let's continue.
					37: A good encounter- let's keep going.
					38: That was a little close for comfort..
					39: That's over with, but we're still in trouble.
					40: That was close.
					41: Another victory for us!
					42: A foregone conclusion- but you did earn it!
					43: What a powerful foe...
					44: Perfect attack!
					45: A critical hit!
					46: Expertly done.
					47: Nice, you hit their weak spot.
					48: That was great!
					49: A decisive blow.
					50: Ouch. That looked like it hurt.
					51: Are you alright?
					52: That doesn't look good.
					53: This could be going better..
					54: Oww..
					55: Yikes.
					56: This is.. bad..
					57: That is.. not good.
					58: They'll pay for that..
					59: A powerful foe approaches. Let's send it back to where it belongs.
					60: I can sense powerful energy approaching. Ready or not, it's time for a fight.
					61: A strong opponent draws near. Prepare yourself.
					62: Stay alert, {0}. Something powerful is on its way.
					63: Danger approaches. We will show no mercy.
					64: Here it comes. Whatever it is, it's dangerous. Take extra care when it's weak; it'll be forced into a frenzy.
					65: That's quite a large slime! It looks to be especially mobile, so don't get stuck where you can't dodge!
					66: This must be the Eater of Worlds. It'll try and suprise you from below- let's try to take advantage of its length.
					67: Watch out. It's trying to attack your mind itself. Pay close attention to the mirages.
					68: That giant bee is attacking! Don't get caught in the honey- and heed its horizontal charges!
					69: The Clothier has turned into.. this.. Stay away from its skull and arms.
					70: This thing is incredibly strong, and quite disgusting to boot. Whatever you do, keep running but don't leave the Underworld!
					71: The Eye of Cthulhu is back? Wait, there's two of them..! Try and focus one at a time!
					72: It's a cyclops... wait.. It has antlers... Is it a deer? Is it both..?
					73: Looks to be another type of gigantic slime. I have a feeling it'll use minions to do its bidding.
					74: Something dangerous stirs in the Hallow... It looks to draw overwhelming power during the daytime!
					75: The Destroyer approaches.. Let's try using area-of-effect attacks against it.
					76: Skeletron is back, and better than ever! Try prioritizing the appendages first.
					77: The menace of the Jungle is attacking..! Don't get stuck on your surroundings!
					78: The Lizhard's beast is awake! Mind the Jungle Temple's traps during this fight.
					79: You've reeled in a dangerous foe! Stay near the sea lest it become enraged!
					80: It's a Lunatic Cultist.. You have to defeat them before they can summon calamity!
					81: The Moon Lord.. We come face to face with a god. We have to win this! There's no other option!
					82: The Warrior of Light approaches.. His Limit Breaks are incredibly strong!
					83: Something about this foe seems familiar... Looks like he can manipulate space to some extent!
					84: Don't underestimate this king of eld!
					85: She's covering you with paint. Take careful note of your color!
					86: It seems to be able to swap forms! Try to memorize its attacks..!
					87: Something's tunneling in the sand..! Try and get off the ground!
					88: A mycelium beast, huh? It's spewing mushrooms everywhere...
					89: The corruption has spewed out a new beast. Look out for its barrage of minions.
					90: Flesh beasts draw near..! Focus your attention on the Hive!
					91: Another foe born from slime. Let's return it to where it belongs- in the ground!
					92: This foe radiates mystic ice. Stay away from it- those icy spikes are not for show.
					93: The Desert Scourge makes a return... I knew it- This was what it once was.
					94: A colossal serpent makes its way towards us... Don't get reckless, this thing is seriously dangerous.
					95: That Charred Idol has summoned a flaming spirit.. It can teleport everywhere- don't lose track of it.
					96: Calamitas.. With a name like that, it begs respect. We've seen what it can do. You musn't lose this fight.
					97: It's Anahita singing again. Do you want to fight her once more?
					98: Can you hear that? Is... something singing in the ocean?
					99: Ah.. It looks like you've angered her. I hope you're prepared for a fight..
					100: What in the world.. It's massive! Take caution; the playing field has changed!
					101: It's a mechanical beast, but it's been corrupted by the Astral Infection. Stay cautious.
					102: Ugh. It's a disgusting bug, but now it has artillery. When it gets wounded, those missiles will likely detonate.
					103: Yuck. It's a huge pile of flesh and bones. From what I can tell, getting too close will end you fast.
					104: This is a descendant of a cosmic god! We can't lose to something like this!
					105: The Profaned Shard has summoned something! Prepare for a fight!
					106: Hey, those pheromones.. Looks like it attracted a feral beast. Let's dispose of it.
					107: A deity of light and darkness approaches!. We musn't lose this..!
					108: Something just entered the upper atmosphere! Brace for impact!
					109: Wait. I sense something from the Dungeon's depths. Prepare yourself for a fight!
					110: A demon is approaching..! Watch out! Whatever it wants, it'll kill you for it!
					111: The ghosts of the dungeon.. They're fusing together! Prepare yourself!
					112: Something descends from the acid rain! It's looking for a fight!
					113: The Devourer of Gods has appeared! You must give this battle your all!
					114: The Jungle Dragon roars. Let's throw a wrench in Yharim's plans.
					115: Huh? Where's it going? We were in the middle of something!
					116: No way.. Its power is ineffable. {0}.. We have to win this!
					117: Draedon is here... Be mindful of his tactics. His knowledge spans the world over.
					118: Stay sharp. Multiple foes detected- Draedon's inventions are on the move.
					119: Quick- find higher ground! A colossal mechanical serpent draws near!
					120: The battlefield is changing- be mindful of your foes, but stay calm and focus.
					121: ...Never mind the absurdity of the giant mechanical squirrel. Focus on attacking its head and arms to stop its most dangerous attacks.
					122: Huh? She looks weak, but she's actually kind of powerful... If you get hit, you'll be slammed with debuffs; keep your healing ready.
					123: Who does this guy think he is, wielding celestial power all willy-nilly? Not to mention... Ugh- I don't have to spell it out, do I?
					124: Well, no time like the present. His arsenal revolves around invader events- we've seen our share of those.
					125: Oh, you just HAD to throw that thing into lava, did you? Well, good luck, because Mutant is pissed. Didn't see that coming- wait, I did.
					126: The Storm Flare has called something down! Hmm? It looks to be lightning-aspected.
					127: Some sort of jellyfish monster is approaching. It looks like there's someone trapped inside..?
					128: It's a giant vampire bat! Mind yourself...
					129: The cavern's energy has congealed into a monster! What in the world..?
					130: A knight has arisen from the marble cave! Look out- it's prepared to fight!
					131: It's an alien spaceship! It looks like it'll be stronger on low HP!
					132: Do you see that..? It looks like a giant snow spider! Let's kill it quickly..
					133: A Beholder..? Don't get reckless.. These foes are incredibly fearsome!
					134: I can sense an undead beast approaching! Get ready for a fight!
					135: The Abyssal Shadows are converging..! This sea monster holds dominion over dark magic!
					136: Primordial energy is forming all around you.. The elements themselves are on the attack!
					137: It's gotten quite hot here- this must be the Desert. I have an inkling we'll be here often- like it or not.
					138: This verdant environment must be the Jungle. I'd make sure we're well equipped before braving its depths.
					139: It's the ocean... We can't cross it, so best leave it be.
					140: You're nearing the limit of breathable air. I do not recommend burning up in the atmosphere. Don't ask.
					141: So this is the place where the dead rest. Let's see what we can find- they aren't using it anymore, hopefully.
					142: I can feel the evil aura radiating from this place. I wouldn't mind leaving as soon as possible.
					143: This place is.. disgusting. Let's not stay longer than we have to.
					144: How curious, a veritable snowscape. Take care to avoid hypothermia- but you should be fine.
					145: We've stepped straight into fairytale land... It would be much prettier if everything here wasn't hostile.
					146: A cavern of giant glowing mushrooms- It feels rather... welcoming? We should take some back home, just in case.
					147: I can feel traps everywhere- Strong weapons are buried here as well. Stay ready.
					148: So this is the meteor impact we heard...
					149: The Brimstone Crag... I can feel the horrors of the past.
					150: This is the Astral Infection. A subject I'm all too familiar with...
					151: This place is quite beautiful. Who knew it would be under the desert..?
					152: From what I can see, this was once a pleasant coastline. What happened here..?
					153: You've decided to breach the ocean's depths. Please consider how dangerous this really is..
					154: This cavern seems to be pure granite. Some rogue spirits have made their home here.
					155: So this is a Marble Cavern. Perhaps we can use the material to build?
					156: We're very deep in the ocean. These waters are trouble, I can tell that much.
					157: It's raining. Hopefully nothing important gets too wet.
					158: Looks like it's a blizzard. 'Cold' doesn't begin to cover it.
					159: A sandstorm has kicked up. Mind your eyes.
					160: Time and space bend to my will!
					161: Let's try that again, shall we?
					162: Chronal reversal complete..!
					163: March forth, and keep fighting!
					164: We're not about to stop here!
					165: Embrace the abyss! Set yourself free!
					166: They'll all fall before us.
					167: Like lambs to slaughter!
					168: We'll finish them all off!
					169: I'm ready when you are.
					170: The Stellar Nova is ready!
					171: I shall give it my all.
					172: Let's do this.
					173: Ready and willing!
					174: Let's find an opening.
					175: Celestial coordinates established. Welcome to the Observatory Hyperborea.
					176: We've made it. These are asteroids of interest. Let's look around.
					177: This is it. An entire planet that's devoid of color? The surface looks like it was wiped away somehow...
					178: Where is this place? It looks very familiar...
					179: It looks like we can't explore this yet... Maybe next time.
					180: Looks like this biome's governed mostly by foliage- a bit more tasteful than the Jungle, I'd say. Let's look around.
					181: Seems like you've bothered that slime enough- it seems to have drastically altered its fighting style.
					182: A Pharaoh in the depths of a pyramid? That sounds about right- but looks like you'll have to deal with what comes next.
					183: I'm getting a bad feeling from this enemy... Let's dispatch of it quickly, lest it do something else with this 'Planetarium.'
					184: Hey, the temperature of your surroundings is dropping dramatically. I'm sure you can see the source of this anomaly- deal with it, fast.
					185: Whatever this thing is, it's hard to even look at. Be careful, it's powerful and lethal.
					186: I think whatever you've done must have had some serious repercussions- a strange entity has emerged, and is heading your way.
					187: Hmm, it seems to be a cluster of uninhabited asteroids. There was definitely life here, but it must have been thousands of years ago.
					188: Looks to be an old mining station. From the looks of it, it was abandoned before the Ardor took root. There won't be any ore left, sadly.
					189: What a strange world- it seems its ambient mana has been entirely drained, leaving the place looking pale white- a unique phenomenon.
					190: Looks like you arrived underground- if you can make it to the surface, it'll look more like home. The creatures here are familiar, which is pretty strange.
					191: The Corruption is a known entity in the universe, but this place is different- it feels as if something larger was Corrupted into this object. Stay alert.
					192: A Crimson-infused moon... After you've gathered what you need, we should excuse ourselves quickly.
					193: Never would I ever have thought I'd see a wooden space-station, of all things... Hold on a moment- is someone still living here?
					194: You've got to be kidding me. It's a horrid, scuttling bug- in armor, no less. Avoid its disgusting minions or else!
					195: The Moon Jellies have combined into a sort of figure? It looks like it wants a fight, so prepare yourself!
					196: Hey, heads up- that thing you just used has awoken a sort of nature entity, and it's headed your way.
					197: I think you've angered this prehistoric bird thing- I hope you've got a plan to take it out of the sky.
					198: A low-orbit entity is rapidly approaching your position- get ready for a fight.
					199: I hate to say this, but you seem to have caught the attention of a fearsome demon- time to prepare for combat.
					200: That crown you just used seems to have summoned a demonic skull... these things aren't usually friendly!
					201: A colossal earthen entity is approaching- and it's hostile, no doubt. A fight it is.
					202: That potion the Astrologian gave you definitely was 'strange' for a reason. Prepare yourself!
					203: I trust you're ready for this?
					204: What is this void... thing? It's nothing short of terrifying.
					205: It's even stronger now?! Any other things I should know about?
					206: You're kidding me.
					207: Let's show this Glassweaver we mean business.
					208: Looks like it took the bait. Time to get to work!
					209: I'm going to wager a guess and say this is whom the Glassweaver spoke of. Don't get careless.
					210: A new vista to explore!
					211: What a curious place...
					212: The exploration continues.
					213: Seems like this world still has its secrets.
					214: Looks like a new area?
					215: What is this place?
					216: (Laugh)
					217: So this is the Everlasting Light... how dreadful.
					218: Seems to be raining again.
					219: Looks like it's beginning to rain.
					220: An exceptional result! Looks like you didn't even get scratched!
					221: A little too close for comfort... but it worked out in the end.
					222: That could've gone worse, I suppose...!
					//Mod: Fargo's Souls:
					//Cursed Coffin
					223: That coffin's started moving- likely provoked by that urn you had. Prepare yourself.
					//Banished Baron
					224: That lure seems to be working- perhaps a bit too well. Stay underwater- it's inflicting some sort of debilitation.
					//Lifelight
					225: Something's emerging from above- I daresay it's time to draw your weapon- doesn't seem affable in the slightest.
					//Mod of Redemption
					//Thorn, Bane of the Forest
					226: Whatever or whoever this once was, their bodily form has been completely overgrown. Watch your step, lest the ground itself ensnare you.
					//Erhan, Anglonic High Priest
					227: It follows reason that a priest would arrive after a demonic summoning- what next?
					//The Keeper
					228: This strange apparition somehow feels like it's longing for something. I can't quite describe it, but there may be another solution to this.
					//Seed of Infection
					229: This disgusting infection threatens to spread unchecked if we fail here... so, let's try not to.
					//King Slayer III
					230: Guess the time for talk is over. I would try to pierce that shield of theirs- physical strikes should do it.
					//1st Omega Prototype
					231: I feel a bit of affinity with a sword that massive- but it's trying to make short work of us, so let's not get distracted.
					//2nd Omega Prototype
					232: Another tunneling foe- seems like the shield cores of this machine are its weakness. Now, how to target them?
					//3rd Omega Prototype
					233: And on cue, another one of these prototypes. I am slightly curious on what 'prepare for obliteration' entails...
					//Patient Zero
					234: The depths of the lab were containing... this. Let's dispatch of it immediately- it bears the same signatures as that seed of infection.
					//Ancient Diety Duo
					235: The weather patterns around you have gone haywire- something's up. Don't get reckless.
					//Nebuleus, Angel of the Cosmos
					236: Something has just descended from orbit- that stone definitely did something. What now?
					//Sir Nautilus
					237: A duel, huh? Leave naught to chance- fight as you would anywhere else.

							1: The Spatial Disk can do a lot of other things, but for now, the Stellar Array is the most important. Remember to check it often!
							2: One last thing.. I can turn energy from other worlds into direct power in the form of Essences. Combining these with other materials should be enough to create powerful Aspected Weapons.

							2: Umm.. what next..? Right. I can turn latent energy from other worlds into crystallized power- an Essence, if you will. You can turn these Essences into Aspected Weapons.

							3: I apologize, Asphodene. This should help. Ring any bells?
							4: Dude. We have GOT to stop meeting like this. The nerve...!
							5: Please, let me explain, Starbearer. In tandem with our galaxy's myriad worlds, there exists Starfarers to aid their denizens. You are familiar with what we do.
							6: As we are conduits of energy, we choose a Starbearer to act as our envoy. You should know that living beings are the best conductors of mana, and we're only partially alive.
							7: However, the First Starfarer's nominee was... unfitting for their role. This is the First Starbearer. From what I know, they seem to have lost their mind and morals.
							8: Now, they continue to roam the galaxy, the Starfarer a thrall to their chosen one's whims. They 'pursue good' through any means necessary, often with casualties.
							9: This is all conjecture, but the destruction is very real. It should go unsaid that we can't let this continue. I'll need your help in the future.
							10: As it stands now, you have little chance of besting them. However, while Asphodene doesn't know it, all Starfarers have an ace up their sleeve: the Stellar Nova.
							11: I've already bequeathed the power to her the second you've won our duel.
							12: That is all for now. I must continue to track the First Starbearer. Good luck- I will have need of you soon.
							13: I know he's a loner, but.. I wish we could have spoken more. Stay safe, Perseus. I can't help but feel he's hiding something from me, though. Just me?
							14: Anyways, he was right. I do feel stronger- and my hair's gone all shiny! This power should be an amazing boon going forward.
							15: Looks like my Stellar Nova is called 'Prototokia Aster.' Perhaps we'll get to use some more once we defeat more powerful foes?
							16: After binding the Stellar Nova Key, you should be able to equip the Stellar Nova through the Spatial Disk, like usual.
							17: You should have some Prismatic Cores already. With their power, I theorize you can upgrade Stellar Novas with crafting.
							18: This is important. You need Stellar Nova Energy to cast Novas. You gain Nova energy in combat, and it depletes outside of combat.
							19: OK. A lot has happened, but this is a huge step forward for us. Please use the Novas well! Bye for now.

							1: Right. Actually, the Observatories weren't intended for us at all, but we're... keeping the place clean. The original inhabitants are long gone anyways.
							2: We might not look it, but we aren't native to this galaxy. We came after- well, it's hard to explain straight out.
							3: Let's pretend the universe is a lake, right? Okay, good. Now imagine someone started pouring oil into the lake- not something you could miss.
							4: Hopefully that explains what's going on here. We ended up discovering this:
							5: This galaxy- the Moirae galaxy- is freezing over. It's not happening all at once, but the farther away from the center you go, things get worse.
							6: The only reason why I met you is because this planet is uniquely habitable, even this far away from the galaxy's center. You can thank your Sun for that.

							2: While it IS important, we have to get stronger before making any moves.

					17: {
						Dialogue: {
							0: Alright. To get started, you'll need to craft a structure called a Stellaglyph.
							1: Within the Observatory is the Celestriad Root. In the interest of keeping this brief, you can use it like a crafting table. It's on a plinth surrounded by stone pillars.
							2: Simply combine one of each type of gemstone to create the Stellaglyph. That's pretty much the hardest part taken care of.
							3: Now, placing the Stellaglyph in your home will open up a Gateway you can use with the Celestial Cartography menu to explore the galaxy in what we call a Cosmic Voyage.
							4: Simply select a destination to teleport directly there- quite a novel way of travel, right?
							5: Of course, there's a few downsides. We're transposing you there instead of normal travel (like with a starship) so you'll have most movement abilities unavailable.
							6: Oh, I recommend taking something like a grappling hook to service you on the Cosmic Voyages. Trust me on this one.
							7: That makes sense. Keep in mind you'll need to be near the Gateway to go to other locations- but if you get stuck, you can just teleport home or the Observatory.
							8: Speaking of locations... if you find any foes on your adventures, you can kill them for a chance at some useful items.
							9: Anomaly locations have much greater loot and rarer enemies, but if you stay for too long...
							10: Let's just say there's a whole host of nasties in the galaxy, and they love visiting these places. Once they're alerted to your presence, they'll come hunting.
							11: After visiting an Anomaly, there'll be a long cooldown before you can visit again, so make every visit count.
							12: Through upgrading the Stellaglyph, you can access more Cosmic Voyage Locations, but you'll have to craft the Stellaglyph upgrades yourself- using the Celestriad Root, of course.
							13: One last thing- there exists certain structures called Stellar Foci, which, when placed near your Stellaglyph, will make you stronger during Cosmic Voyages.
							14: They'll be super helpful in the long run, but they're pretty difficult to craft. Maybe we'll find a source somewhere?
							15: Okay, that's it! Did you get all that?

							3: It wasn't the prettiest place 'n all, but was important 'n such to the Empire, seems like. The Ardor takin' it was big in their eyes.
							4: Outposts 'n the Third Region stopped gettin' their rations, an' that'd be the end of it. Trade ships ain't stayin' w'en the breadwinners are movin' inwards.
							5: Followin' that, more an' more planets froze over. There'd be a time where a whole Empire fleet went with all their smart types to try and find out the happenin'.
							6: I try 'n stay away from the bigwigs, so I can't give any info 'bout that. Best be knowin' Empire fleets don't go places lightly 'n all. Even heard wind of a Knight comin' with em.
							7: All I know 'bout that is them figurin' out that the mana, y'see, ain't replenishin' like normal. Nothin' but tech is gonna be workin' at this rate- an' the Empire uses magic 'n tech both.
							8: That'd be leadin' the story to now. The fleet's gone an' left, an' anyone holdin' out worth their salt with 'em. I'm in the business of followin' the money, which leads me to these backwaters.

							5: Sure, the Empire's gotten themselves an ol' no-tolerance party, but patrols ain't turnin' down bribes, last time I did some checkin'.

		Bestiary: {
			ArbitrationBoss: A horrifying figure encountered within a mysterious location known as Katabasis. While it appears evil to a human, eldritch anomalies such as these know not the concept of malice.
			AstralCell: A strange blue object. It eats water vapor.
			NalhaunBossPhase2: A once mighty monarch, cursed to live eternally by means of a betrayal from his royal court. He persisted alone on an empty planet until the First Starbearer ended his long and tragic reign, as he would be able to interfere with his plans. While he may have stood a chance at his full might, he was burdened by a dreadful civil war tearing his world apart.
			PaintedAttendantA: Utilized by Penthesilea to... smack you in the face. The best mages know when physical violence is the answer.
			PenthesileaBoss: An incredibly powerful mage, the Painted Witch once ruled a planet entirely 'drawn' by her. Ever the trickster, she mastered expert magecraft simply to play pranks upon the works of her colleagues, a testament to her ingenuity. She met her end at the hands of the First Starbearer after a long conflict- if she were to persist, she would interfere with his plans...
			PrismLoot: The latent magical energy of Prismatic Cores can sometimes influence them to drift around the galaxy. Catch one, and you'll be rewarded!
			SpectreOfLight: An otherworldy hero, summoned forth by the First Starbearer to assail this land.
			TsukiyomiBoss: The First Starfarer, Tsukiyomi, who holds dominion over orbiting celestial bodies. The gravitational pull of a planet and its natural satellites gives her power. She led the Warrior of Light astray- using his strength and goodwill to conquer and destroy myriad stars... and yet...
			CastorBoss: The Force of Fire, a Baleborn. The Baleborn are an incredibly competitive race of demonkin, and their blood relations have served only to further kindle the fires of conflict. They are completely engrossed in their duel, aware of nothing but their opponent's actions. Ironically, this has made them quite mediocre fighters against any other opponent. They were utterly destroyed by the First Starbearer, attacking him as he unwittingly interfered with their eternal battle.
			PolluxBoss: The Forces of Ice and Fire, twin Baleborn. The Baleborn are an incredibly competitive race of demonkin, and their blood relations have served only to further kindle the fires of conflict. They are completely engrossed in their duel, aware of nothing but their opponent's actions. Ironically, this has made them quite mediocre fighters against any other opponent. They were utterly destroyed by the First Starbearer, attacking him as he unwittingly interfered with their eternal battle.
			VagrantBoss: The enigmatic Starfarer Perseus. His outward appearance is that of utmost confidence... but he's just kind of a dork trying to look cool. His sisters agree on this. He continues to have power over spatial distances, but seems to have lost the power to control time (but not the moniker.)
			WarriorOfLight: The Warrior of Light, or the First Starbearer, once championed justice in the galaxy through his actions and the aid of his Starfarer. He once ruled a peaceful world, but was forced to watch helplessly as his people met their demise, vowing to never again let others share the same fate- no matter the cost.
			AsteroidWorm: These incredibly hardy creatures have grown the capability to aimlessly drift through the vacuum of space- perhaps not the best depiction of evolution. While their meals are scarce, their need for food is nigh nonexistant. Gifted with a strong outer shell, but low overall attacking strength.
			Soulless: An unfortunate victim of whatever apocalypse befell Caelum. Mana keeps their incarnation alive, but whatever trace of thought they may have once had has long since departed.
			Yojimbo: A mysterious lumenkin, his name seems to change depending on when and where you come across him. He's a bounty hunter, but is willing to part with some knowledge if you pry enough...
			Garridine: A lupine demihuman you discovered residing on a far-flung starship, a blacksmith and gadgeteer. Her manner of speaking belies a high-class upbringing, but the facade tends to drop when she flubs her words (which is often.) Strangely protective of the watch by her side.
			AmethystHeadpiercer: Foot soldier of a wide-reaching paramilitary organization, referred to as the Amethyst. Equipped with a Vortexian powersuit fitted with a jetpack for ease of travel, even in the vacuum of space.
			AmethystSwordsinner: Foot soldier of a wide-reaching paramilitary organization, referred to as the Amethyst. Utilizes a hardlight blade with ferocious efficiency, specifically for countering ranged offense.
			Tsukiyomi2: ???
			ThespianBoss: A legendary alchemist long dead reanimated by a terrifying agent of chaos. For one as far gone as he, you must act as he demands, lest you meet your untimely end...
			StarfarerBoss: Yep, it's us.
			LogicBombEnemy: The payload of a Logic Virus, this bundle of energy tries to dive bomb living creatures to hopefully transform them into more Logic Viruses. However, this works only on robots, so it'll just feel like a ton of hot plasma smacking you in the face, which could be considered worse.
			LogicVirusEnemy: A strange miniscule soldier, the Logic Viruses are characterized by their dastardly payloads and their ability to multiply, causing quite a nuisiance. Too bad they seem to have poor locomotive capabilities in walled environs.
			SemaphoreEnemy: A strange winged device, the Semaphores will dislodge raw data from the Neon Veil's sky and cause it to plummet (hopefully on your beautiful head.)
