			Garridine.1: You needn't have come all this way- a letter would have sufficed. Hmm, how would the letter arrive? I see.

			Astrologian: {
				WizardDialogue: I'm not sure what to think of {0}. They're obviously a cosplayer- you'd expect them to know no magic... and yet..!
				FirstDialogue: Salulations, friend. My collection magecraft has led me to you- I see you've found a celestial relic. If you are willing to part with some coin, a portion of my collection can be yours- or, I can also sell you the means to utilize it.
				StandardDialogue1: I think I'm going broke.
				StandardDialogue2: Looks like today's going to be bad luck. Or is it good luck? If only I had a better view.
				StandardDialogue3: You want to know more information about Starfarers? They're a known phenomenon, but most of their impact is consigned to history books. In fact, it's strange you ask.
				StandardDialogue4: Astrology extends far beyond star signs and constellations. To an extent, you must have ample magical knowledge and scientific expertise.
				StandardDialogue5: I collect and categorize celestial relics. You most likely are not interested in the majority of them.
				StandardDialogue6: Yes, things are expensive- that's just how it is. How am I to buy anything?
				BloodMoon: Hmm, a strange celestial body seems to be affecting our moon. What a pain.
				Party: Yeah, right. I'm not going outside, but I will partake in the food.
				Graveyard: Where in the world is all this accursed fog coming from?
				StrangePotion: Strange Potion
				ThespianNotReadyCorruption: I have something you may be interested in, but you must prepare better. How about dealing with the issues in the Corruption first?
				ThespianNotReadyCrimson: I have something you may be interested in, but you must prepare better. How about dealing with the issues in the Crimson first?
				ThespianReady: Here's something you might take interest with: this potion has a magical trace I've never once encountered before- very powerful. It does no good languishing in my stockpile, so take it before I change my mind.
				RareDialogue1: Haha, you say I resemble other members of my profession? Have you ever considered... they're also me?
				RareDialogue2: Have you guessed? Yes, I'm faekin- a faerie. No, I don't do magic tricks.
				AstralDialogue: I can sense the Astral Aspect upon you- if you were not aware, 'aspect' is a misnomer. In fact, being Astral aspected is more of a polarity. How you are aspected itself is a wonder... You must be hiding something.
				UmbralDialogue: I can sense the Umbral Aspect upon you- if you were not aware, 'aspect' is a misnomer. In fact, being Umbral aspected is more of a polarity. How you are aspected itself is a wonder... You must be hiding something.

					onPoison: {
						1: Looks like you've been poisoned. I'll send you a get well card.
						2: Poison, huh? Perhaps a glass of milk would... Never mind.
						3: You look sick- but I guess you don't need me to say that.
						4: If you have an antidote, now's the time...
					}

					onIchor: {
						1: It looks like your defenses are lowered! Be careful.
						2: That substance is weakening your armor- don't get caught unaware.
						3: Eww, you've been covered in Ichor. Mind your health.
					}

					onSilence: {
						1: You've been silenced! Magic is out of the question.
						2: Something's silenced you- guess it's time to get physical!
						3: Your magic has been sealed! Let's get back to basics.
					}

					onCurse: {
						1: I think you've been cursed. That's... not good. You aren't able to use anything for now.
						2: A curse... your items can't be used- let's try to fall back.
						3: Looks like you've had your items sealed. High time for a tactical retreat.
					}

					onFrozen: {
						1: You've been frozen! Oh, you probably knew that.
						2: A total freeze? Great. Get ready to react once you're free.
					}

					onFrostburn: {
						1: You're burning up? Or freezing? It looks like it hurts regardless!
						2: Yikes- a mix of fire and ice? Hang in there!
						3: Well, that looks like it hurts.
					}

					onWebbed: {
						1: Ew. It looks like you're covered in webs.
						2: Covered in webs... Don't fret, it usually comes off after a few washes.
					}

					onStoned: {
						1: You've been petrified! How does that even work?
						2: You've been turned to stone?! Can you even hear me?
					}

					onBurning: {
						1: You're standing on something REALLY hot. I'm no expert on thermodynamics, but you should not do that.
						2: You should probably move...
					}

					onSuffocation: {
						1: You're dying- and quickly. Get out of there!
						2: Looks like you're in trouble... time to focus!
					}

					onFire: {
						1: Well, that isn't good.
						2: Don't think I need to tell you that being on fire does not help the ol' lifespan.
						3: Uh, did you mean to start melting?
						4: Why yes, you can catch fire. Unfortunately.
					}

					onDrowning: {
						1: I hate to break this to you, but you're about to drown.
						2: Whatever you're swimming for, it can wait.
					}

					onBleeding: {
						1: You're losing a LOT of blood. Yikes. You can't regenerate health any more.
						2: You may be the strongest one here, but you're also bleeding profusely.
					}

					onConfusion: {
						1: "[You can't make out the words- looks like you've been confused.] "
						2: Something hit you on the head? You're looking a little loopy. Okay, more than a little loopy.

					1: Looks like you've been poisoned. I'll send you a get well card.

					15: Whoops..
					16: Sorry, little guy.
					17: Oops.
					18: That's one down.
					19: One more defeated!
					20: That takes care of that.
					21: Another one down.
					22: You're great at this!
					23: Nice work. That's one down.
					24: There it goes!
					25: That'll teach em!
					26: That'll show them!
					27: Don't mess with us!
					28: Easy!
					29: Didn't even break a sweat.
					30: That was so easy!
					31: Enough of that one.
					32: An easy victory.
					33: Right, that's that.
					34: How could we ever lose?
					35: It's over.
					36: No more of that.
					37: A good encounter.
					38: That was close..
					39: That was almost really bad.
					40: Thank goodness we killed it in time.
					41: Victory! And not a moment too soon.
					42: That was well-earned, if I do say so myself!
					43: That was a strong one.
					44: A decisive crit!
					45: They felt that one!
					46: A perfectly-timed attack.
					47: Nice, you hit their weak spot.
					48: A critical hit..!
					49: Well struck. That was definitely critical.
					50: Wow. I felt that one..
					51: That's.. not good.
					52: Ouch...
					53: That wasn't good at all..
					54: You should probably heal after that one.
					55: Barely a scratch.. right?
					56: That wasn't supposed to happen..
					57: I don't think you can walk that one off.
					58: ...Ouch.
					59: A powerful foe approaches! We aren't going to lose this.
					60: An incredibly strong foe draws near! Let's give them a fight to remember!
					61: A strong foe draws near. It's time to fight.
					62: Right. No more games. A powerful foe is approaching.
					63: Looks like danger's on the horizon, {0}. I've been itching for a fight!
					64: Looks like trouble. Watch yourself- it's a big one- and I don't think it'll go down without a fight!
					65: It's the lord of the slimes! I think it has a teleportation-like ability, so don't get trapped where you can't dodge.
					66: A colossal worm! Watch where it emerges; it'll try and hit your blind spots, but we can take advantage of its length for piercing attacks!
					67: This thing is trying to attack your mind directly..! Don't be fooled by the mirages!
					68: Watch out.. the Queen Bee is awake! Make sure to stay clear of its charges!
					69: Don't underestimate this monster! Stay away from his skull and arms- I'm sure it has a weakness somewhere...!
					70: That thing is massive! Whatever you do, don't leave the Underworld, and look where you're going as well!
					71: There's two giant eyeballs coming your way! Let's see... The red one will shoot at you, and the green one charges, I think- don't get tunnel vision!
					72: What in the world is that thing? A deer? It's only got one eye... aim for it!
					73: It's another colossal slime! It looks like it's going to split into more slimes- don't get caught off guard!
					74: A Hallow-aspected foe has appeared! Maybe leave the butterfly alone next time...?
					75: A giant mechanical worm.. What can we do..? How about trying to attack multiple parts of it at once?
					76: It's a more advanced version of Skeletron.. Try going for the arms first, instead of the head.
					77: Plantera is awake! Be mindful of its vines. It would be great to have a huge arena to fight it in.
					78: An ancient mechanical monster.. Watch out for the traps in the temple while fighting it.
					79: You reeled in something crazy! Something tells me you should stay near the sea!
					80: It's one of those Lunatic Cultists.. Stop them before they unleash a calamity..!
					81: I can't believe it.. it's the Moon Lord! This is the final battle! We have to win this!
					82: The Warrior of Light approaches.. When he breaks his limits, prepare yourself!
					83: Something about this foe seems familiar... Look out for his sword- seems it can take on different forms!
					84: Don't underestimate this foe..!
					85: This witch attacks with paint! Mind what color you're doused in!
					86: This thing changes its attack patterns! Take note of its stances, or else!
					87: There's something coming from below, and fast! Prepare yourself.. this is one strong worm!
					88: It's a massive moving mass of mycelium.. Let's take out the trash!
					89: A corrupted beast draws near! Kill its minions quickly, lest it overwhelm you!
					90: What in the world is that thing? Aim for that disgusting Hive before it's too late!
					91: So this is the source of all the world's slimes. Don't get hasty; I'm certain those slimes will split when hurt!
					92: Something is strange about this thing, but I don't know what. Don't get frozen... but you could probably already tell.
					93: Hey, it's the Desert Scourge- but not so dried up! We've seen one before, how bad could this one be?
					94: It's a giant sea serpent! Hang on... This thing is SERIOUSLY dangerous!
					95: The flames have brought forth a demonic spirit! Take care to watch your footing, lest you succumb to lava!
					96: This thing... it's a herald of destruction.. I'm sure you know what kind of trouble it can bring. Don't lose!
					97: ...It's Anahita again. Are you going to challenge the Leviathan?
					98: ...Do you hear that? Whatever it is.. it sounds really dangerous.
					99: That demon of the sea is fighting back! I hope you're ready for this...
					100: Whoa. This thing is enormous!! Who knew she had this up her sleeve..?
					101: The Astral Infection has corrupted whatever this was. Don't underestimate it. The Infection can do anything...
					102: Oh, great.. a giant robotic bug. It kind of looks like the Queen Bee, so try and remember her attacks!
					103: This is.. an amalgamation of flesh and machinery.. Above everything, try and stay away from it!
					104: A descendant of a cosmic god! {0}, don't get reckless!
					105: Something's reacting to the Profaned Shard! Prepare for a fight!
					106: You've summoned a draconic monster..! It looks to be incredibly quick!
					107: The fiery god of both light and dark descends.. No way we're losing to this thing!
					108: A spatial worm is approaching! Don't get careless.
					109: That rune has summoned some sort of.. void entity..?
					110: Someone.. or something.. is approaching. It can shapeshift at will! Get ready!
					111: Something's awake. The Dungeon's volatile spirits have coalesed...
					112: The acid ocean has spat out a monster! Wait until it gets tired to strike!
					113: The Devourer of Gods has arrived! Fight! Fight with all your strength!
					114: Yharim's loyal beast, in the flesh..! Let's send this tyrant down a peg!
					115: Huh? Where's it going? We were in the middle of something!
					116: We bow to no one! Let's bring this witch down!
					117: This is Yharim's loyal scientist. His knowledge is nigh-infinite.. Stay cautious.
					118: Twin mechanical eyes- incredibly powerful. Don't get overwhelmed..!
					119: The very earth trembles before this foe. Draedon's toys have become stronger...
					120: Heads up, {0}! Looks like that machine's blotting out the whole sky!
					121: Whoa, look at this thing. What a go-getter! Oh, right- strategy. Looks like you can aim for its arms, so try that.
					122: Aww, this pint-sized witch wants a fight? Alright then! It looks like you'll be barraged with debuffs- Get the heals ready.
					123: Hah? Just look at this muppet... thinking he's better than us or something! Give him a good whallop!
					124: Let's get this show started! He'll be attacking with the power of worldly invaders, if you remember those!
					125: If I had a nickel for times you've thrown voodoo dolls into lava... Never mind. Mutant's super upset, super strong, and super coming straight for you.
					126: A lightning bird is approaching! It's not too powerful, but don't get careless.
					127: Hey. Doesn't that jellyfish look a little too big? Whatever its issue is, it's coming this way!
					128: Ugh, what is that thing? A vampire? Quick, find some silver! Or is that werewolves..?
					129: Looks like the granite has woken up..? Time to bury it where it belongs.
					130: This gladiator looks stronger than the others. Let's give it a fight to remember!
					131: It's an alien spaceship! It looks like it'll be stronger on low HP!
					132: Watch yourself.. looks like a Borean Strider is nearby.
					133: Looks like a Beholder's reacted with the Void Lens. Let's stab it in its big ugly eye..!
					134: Tributes to the thing in the graveyard has summoned a powerful foe. I don't know what else you expected!
					135: The Abyssal Shadows are converging! I sense powerful dark magic from this sea creature..
					136: The elements themselves are on the hunt. Let's show them a thing or two!
					137: It's sweltering here. Deserts will be the same wherever you are, I guess.
					138: So this is the Jungle. Take care when exploring. Ah, but make sure to explore everything!
					139: Well, it's the ocean. ...Did you want me to say something else? It's an ocean.
					140: Isn't it nice up here?
					141: The Underworld, huh? Interesting. This goes without saying, but it's incredibly dangerous here.
					142: The world is being corrupted away here. Let's not tarry.
					143: The ground here feels like flesh. I feel like we shouldn't stay long- but that's obvious..
					144: It's snow! I've been always fond of snow. The water-based kind, of course.
					145: It's the Hallow, the stuff of legend! Awesome! Everything here wants to kill us, though. Bummer.
					146: Whoa! This place is funky. You don't see these mushrooms every day.
					147: There's a skele-ton of enemies here! Don't you enjoy a little danger? I sure do.
					148: So this is the meteor impact we heard...
					149: This is.. the Brimstone Crag. Something dreadful happened here.
					150: So this is the Astral Infection. I've read about it, but actually seeing it...
					151: Wow.. This place is quite unique. I can't quite explain.
					152: Whatever was done to this place is irreversible. This ocean has been stained red with blood.
					153: You're entering the true depths of the ocean. I hope you realize how dangerous this is!
					154: This cavern seems to be made of hard granite.. Curious.
					155: This cave exhudes royalty. Perhaps it has to do with the abundance of marble.
					156: This is a deep part of the ocean. Take care you don't drown...
					157: Looks like it started raining. Hopefully this doesn't put a damper on things.. heh.
					158: It's a blizzard! Don't get frostbite, now. That'd be embarassing.
					159: A sandstorm has kicked up. It gets everywhere, so be careful.
					160: Time and space bend to my will!
					161: Not on my watch!
					162: Turn back the clock..!
					163: By your undying rage..!
					164: It's just a flesh wound.
					165: Embrace the abyss! Set yourself free!
					166: No one will escape!
					167: Like lambs to slaughter!
					168: Butcher them!
					169: Let's show them our power.
					170: I'm ready to unleash my power!
					171: I'm ready to use the Stellar Nova!
					172: OK. Done charging- let's go.
					173: Just tell me when.
					174: Here we go.
					175: You've made it to the Observatory! So, what do you think?
					176: Looks like you've arrived.  These are asteroids of interest- let's do some exploring.
					177: We've made it. This planet is strange.. The surface has been wiped clean... What happened?
					178: What is this place?
					179: It looks like we can't explore this yet... Maybe next time.
					180: Wow, this place is seriously covered in greenery. Looks like a fun trip- let's get to exploring!
					181: Okay, that slime's stopped holding back. Let's dig in our heels for a fight.
					182: Not the treasure I was expecting... Prepare yourself, that evil spirit's planning a dastardly attack.
					183: Something about this foe rubs me the wrong way. Don't let your guard down, lest it do something with this 'Planetarium' thing.
					184: It's getting seriously cold around you. Heads up: this snowflake-shaped being is coming your way.
					185: Don't make light of this foe- it's seriously dangerous. Hehe- but seriously, this thing's no joke. Take caution.
					186: I love throwing explosives as much as the next guy, but it seems you've been punished for that. Prepare for a fight.
					187: There were definitely living beings here- maybe ten thousand or so years ago. Goes without saying anything they used to own is ours now once we find it!
					188: While this IS an abandoned mining facility, I doubt they left without picking clean any ore nearby. We might find other useful things, however.
					189: I can't find any trace of ambient mana- someone, or something, must have drained this entire world dry. Let's check out that structure in the distance.
					190: This planet should look a lot like your own Jungle, but it seems you've ended up underground- which decidedly does not look familiar. The monsters here are, though- strange.
					191: This is a pretty large patch of Corruption- but as long as it isn't moving anywhere, it shouldn't be a threat we need to stop. Still, it's a bit of a eyesore.
					192: An entire moon covered in Crimson- yuck. I wouldn't want to be stranded here, so mind where the Gateway is and you should be fine.
					193: Isn't this strange? Nobody would seriously think of making a space station out of wood, right? Huh- I could have sworn there was someone living here...?
					194: A desert scarab is coming straight for you- and it's covered in armor!
					195: Those jellyfish seem to have coalesed- looks like it has some powerful lightning abilities!
					196: Something in this briar stirs- if you haven't already, time to prep for a fight.
					197: Hey, eyes up! A bird-like creature is coming straight for you... Doesn't look like any bird I've seen before!
					198: Something's barreling through the asteroid field at a rapid pace! Don't get reckless...!
					199: A demon approaches! I guess it makes sense- we are in the Underworld, after all! Let's give them a warm welcome.
					200: I don't know what you just used, but a terrifying skull monster is on its way. Guess I should've seen this coming.
					201: A huge crystalline foe approaches- needless to say, prepare for a fight.
					202: Ack; looks like that potion did do something. Don't let your guard down.
					203: Get ready, because I won't hold back!
					204: What IS that thing?! A being of pure void energy...
					205: It's even stronger now?! Hey, isn't this, like... really bad?
					206: You're kidding me.
					207: Well, let's show 'em what we can do.
					208: You've attracted that squid! So... what now? Beat it up, I guess?
					209: So this is that sentinel, huh? Looks pretty tough!
					210: I wonder what we'll find?
					211: This place certainly is interesting!
					212: Looks like a new locale to explore!
					213: Something new on the horizon.
					214: Seems to me we've stumbled across something new.
					215: What is this place?
					216: (Laugh)
					217: The sky's so bright... This can't be good!
					218: Rain again, huh?
					219: Looks like it's starting to rain.
					220: That was amazing! You didn't even get hit at all!
					221: That was close! At least we won in the end.
					222: Phew! In the end, victory is all that matters.

						2: So, your body temperature is around 300 degrees above normal. You're probably aware, though...

					20: Well fought.
					21: Another one down.
					22: You're pretty good at this.
					23: Nice work.
					24: They'll never beat us.
					25: You've defeated it.
					26: That'll show them.
					27: A good fight.
					28: Easy.
					29: No sweat.
					30: Wasn't even a problem.
					31: We got that taken care of.
					32: Good going.

					44: Perfect attack!
					45: A critical hit!
					46: Expertly done.
					47: Nice, you hit their weak spot.
					48: That was great!
					49: A decisive blow.

					53: This could be going better..
					54: Oww..
					55: Yikes.
					56: This is.. bad..
					57: That is.. not good.
					58: They'll pay for that..
					59: A powerful foe approaches. Let's send it back to where it belongs.
					60: I can sense powerful energy approaching. Ready or not, it's time for a fight.
					61: A strong opponent draws near. Prepare yourself.
					62: Stay alert, {0}. Something powerful is on its way.
					63: Danger approaches. We will show no mercy.
					64: Here it comes. Whatever it is, it's dangerous. Take extra care when it's weak; it'll be forced into a frenzy.
					65: That's quite a large slime! It looks to be especially mobile, so don't get stuck where you can't dodge!
					66: This must be the Eater of Worlds. It'll try and suprise you from below- let's try to take advantage of its length.
					67: Watch out. It's trying to attack your mind itself. Pay close attention to the mirages.
					68: That giant bee is attacking! Don't get caught in the honey- and heed its horizontal charges!
					69: The Clothier has turned into.. this.. Stay away from its skull and arms.
					70: This thing is incredibly strong, and quite disgusting to boot. Whatever you do, keep running but don't leave the Underworld!
					71: The Eye of Cthulhu is back? Wait, there's two of them..! Try and focus one at a time!
					72: It's a cyclops... wait.. It has antlers... Is it a deer? Is it both..?
					73: Looks to be another type of gigantic slime. I have a feeling it'll use minions to do its bidding.
					74: Something dangerous stirs in the Hallow... It looks to draw overwhelming power during the daytime!
					75: The Destroyer approaches.. Let's try using area-of-effect attacks against it.
					76: Skeletron is back, and better than ever! Try prioritizing the appendages first.
					77: The menace of the Jungle is attacking..! Don't get stuck on your surroundings!
					78: The Lizhard's beast is awake! Mind the Jungle Temple's traps during this fight.
					79: You've reeled in a dangerous foe! Stay near the sea lest it become enraged!
					80: It's a Lunatic Cultist.. You have to defeat them before they can summon calamity!
					81: The Moon Lord.. We come face to face with a god. We have to win this! There's no other option!
					82: The Warrior of Light approaches.. His Limit Breaks are incredibly strong!
					83: Something about this foe seems familiar... Looks like he can manipulate space to some extent!
					84: Don't underestimate this king of eld!
					85: She's covering you with paint. Take careful note of your color!
					86: It seems to be able to swap forms! Try to memorize its attacks..!
					87: Something's tunneling in the sand..! Try and get off the ground!
					88: A mycelium beast, huh? It's spewing mushrooms everywhere...
					89: The corruption has spewed out a new beast. Look out for its barrage of minions.
					90: Flesh beasts draw near..! Focus your attention on the Hive!
					91: Another foe born from slime. Let's return it to where it belongs- in the ground!
					92: This foe radiates mystic ice. Stay away from it- those icy spikes are not for show.
					93: The Desert Scourge makes a return... I knew it- This was what it once was.
					94: A colossal serpent makes its way towards us... Don't get reckless, this thing is seriously dangerous.
					95: That Charred Idol has summoned a flaming spirit.. It can teleport everywhere- don't lose track of it.
					96: Calamitas.. With a name like that, it begs respect. We've seen what it can do. You musn't lose this fight.
					97: It's Anahita singing again. Do you want to fight her once more?
					98: Can you hear that? Is... something singing in the ocean?
					99: Ah.. It looks like you've angered her. I hope you're prepared for a fight..
					100: What in the world.. It's massive! Take caution; the playing field has changed!
					101: It's a mechanical beast, but it's been corrupted by the Astral Infection. Stay cautious.
					102: Ugh. It's a disgusting bug, but now it has artillery. When it gets wounded, those missiles will likely detonate.
					103: Yuck. It's a huge pile of flesh and bones. From what I can tell, getting too close will end you fast.
					104: This is a descendant of a cosmic god! We can't lose to something like this!
					105: The Profaned Shard has summoned something! Prepare for a fight!
					106: Hey, those pheromones.. Looks like it attracted a feral beast. Let's dispose of it.
					107: A deity of light and darkness approaches!. We musn't lose this..!
					108: Something just entered the upper atmosphere! Brace for impact!
					109: Wait. I sense something from the Dungeon's depths. Prepare yourself for a fight!
					110: A demon is approaching..! Watch out! Whatever it wants, it'll kill you for it!
					111: The ghosts of the dungeon.. They're fusing together! Prepare yourself!
					112: Something descends from the acid rain! It's looking for a fight!
					113: The Devourer of Gods has appeared! You must give this battle your all!
					114: The Jungle Dragon roars. Let's throw a wrench in Yharim's plans.
					115: Huh? Where's it going? We were in the middle of something!
					116: No way.. Its power is ineffable. {0}.. We have to win this!
					117: Draedon is here... Be mindful of his tactics. His knowledge spans the world over.
					118: Stay sharp. Multiple foes detected- Draedon's inventions are on the move.
					119: Quick- find higher ground! A colossal mechanical serpent draws near!
					120: The battlefield is changing- be mindful of your foes, but stay calm and focus.
					121: ...Never mind the absurdity of the giant mechanical squirrel. Focus on attacking its head and arms to stop its most dangerous attacks.
					122: Huh? She looks weak, but she's actually kind of powerful... If you get hit, you'll be slammed with debuffs; keep your healing ready.
					123: Who does this guy think he is, wielding celestial power all willy-nilly? Not to mention... Ugh- I don't have to spell it out, do I?
					124: Well, no time like the present. His arsenal revolves around invader events- we've seen our share of those.
					125: Oh, you just HAD to throw that thing into lava, did you? Well, good luck, because Mutant is pissed. Didn't see that coming- wait, I did.
					126: The Storm Flare has called something down! Hmm? It looks to be lightning-aspected.
					127: Some sort of jellyfish monster is approaching. It looks like there's someone trapped inside..?
					128: It's a giant vampire bat! Mind yourself...
					129: The cavern's energy has congealed into a monster! What in the world..?
					130: A knight has arisen from the marble cave! Look out- it's prepared to fight!
					131: It's an alien spaceship! It looks like it'll be stronger on low HP!
					132: Do you see that..? It looks like a giant snow spider! Let's kill it quickly..
					133: A Beholder..? Don't get reckless.. These foes are incredibly fearsome!
					134: I can sense an undead beast approaching! Get ready for a fight!
					135: The Abyssal Shadows are converging..! This sea monster holds dominion over dark magic!
					136: Primordial energy is forming all around you.. The elements themselves are on the attack!
					137: It's gotten quite hot here- this must be the Desert. I have an inkling we'll be here often- like it or not.
					138: This verdant environment must be the Jungle. I'd make sure we're well equipped before braving its depths.
					139: You're nearing the limit of breathable air. I do not recommend burning up in the atmosphere. Don't ask.
					140: So this is the place where the dead rest. Let's see what we can find.
					141: It's the ocean... We can't cross it, so best leave it be.
					142: I can feel the evil aura radiating from this place. I wouldn't mind leaving as soon as possible.
					143: This place is.. disgusting. Let's not stay longer than we have to.
					144: How curious, a veritable snowscape. Take care to avoid hypothermia- but you should be fine.
					145: We've stepped straight into fairytale land... It would be much prettier if everything here wasn't hostile.
					146: A cavern of giant glowing mushrooms- It feels rather... welcoming? We should take some back home, just in case.
					147: I can feel traps everywhere- Strong weapons are buried here as well. Stay ready.
					148: So this is the meteor impact we heard...
					149: The Brimstone Crag... I can feel the horrors of the past.
					150: This is the Astral Infection. A subject I'm all too familiar with...
					151: This place is quite beautiful. Who knew it would be under the desert..?
					152: From what I can see, this was once a pleasant coastline. What happened here..?
					153: You've decided to breach the ocean's depths. Please consider how dangerous this really is..
					154: This cavern seems to be pure granite. Some rogue spirits have made their home here.
					155: So this is a Marble Cavern. Perhaps we can use the material to build?
					156: We're very deep in the ocean. These waters are trouble, I can tell that much.
					157: It's raining. Hopefully nothing important gets too wet.
					158: Looks like it's a blizzard. 'Cold' doesn't begin to cover it.
					159: A sandstorm has kicked up. Mind your eyes.
					160: Time and space bend to my will!
					161: Let's try that again, shall we?
					162: Chronal reversal complete..!
					163: March forth, and keep fighting!
					164: We're not about to stop here!
					165: Embrace the abyss! Set yourself free!
					166: They'll all fall before us.
					167: Like lambs to slaughter!
					168: We'll finish them all off!
					169: I'm ready when you are.
					170: The Stellar Nova is ready!
					171: I shall give it my all.
					172: Let's do this.
					173: Ready and willing!
					174: Let's find an opening.
					175: Celestial coordinates established. Welcome to the Observatory Hyperborea.
					176: We've made it. These are asteroids of interest. Let's look around.
					177: This is it. An entire planet that's devoid of color? The surface looks like it was wiped away somehow...
					178: Where is this place? It looks very familiar...
					179: It looks like we can't explore this yet... Maybe next time.
					180: Looks like this biome's governed mostly by foliage- a bit more tasteful than the Jungle, I'd say. Let's look around.
					181: Seems like you've bothered that slime enough- it seems to have drastically altered its fighting style.
					182: A Pharaoh in the depths of a pyramid? That sounds about right- but looks like you'll have to deal with what comes next.
					183: I'm getting a bad feeling from this enemy... Let's dispatch of it quickly, lest it do something else with this 'Planetarium.'
					184: Hey, the temperature of your surroundings is dropping dramatically. I'm sure you can see the source of this anomaly- deal with it, fast.
					185: Whatever this thing is, it's hard to even look at. Be careful, it's powerful and lethal.
					186: I think whatever you've done must have had some serious repercussions- a strange entity has emerged, and is heading your way.
					187: Hmm, it seems to be a cluster of uninhabited asteroids. There was definitely life here, but it must have been thousands of years ago.
					188: Looks to be an old mining station. From the looks of it, it was abandoned before the Ardor took root. There won't be any ore left, sadly.
					189: What a strange world- it seems its ambient mana has been entirely drained, leaving the place looking pale white- a unique phenomenon.
					190: Looks like you arrived underground- if you can make it to the surface, it'll look more like home. The creatures here are familiar, which is pretty strange.
					191: The Corruption is a known entity in the universe, but this place is different- it feels as if something larger was Corrupted into this object. Stay alert.
					192: A Crimson-infused moon... After you've gathered what you need, we should excuse ourselves quickly.
					193: Never would I ever have thought I'd see a wooden space-station, of all things... Hold on a moment- is someone still living here?
					194: You've got to be kidding me. It's a horrid, scuttling bug- in armor, no less. Avoid its disgusting minions or else!
					195: The Moon Jellies have combined into a sort of figure? It looks like it wants a fight, so prepare yourself!
					196: Hey, heads up- that thing you just used has awoken a sort of nature entity, and it's headed your way.
					197: I think you've angered this prehistoric bird thing- I hope you've got a plan to take it out of the sky.
					198: A low-orbit entity is rapidly approaching your position- get ready for a fight.
					199: I hate to say this, but you seem to have caught the attention of a fearsome demon- time to prepare for combat.
					200: That crown you just used seems to have summoned a demonic skull... these things aren't usually friendly!
					201: A colossal earthen entity is approaching- and it's hostile, no doubt. A fight it is.
					202: That potion the Astrologian gave you definitely was 'strange' for a reason. Prepare yourself!
					203: I trust you're ready for this?
					204: What is this void... thing? It's nothing short of terrifying.
					205: It's even stronger now?! Any other things I should know about?
					206: You're kidding me.
					207: Let's show this Glassweaver we mean business.
					208: Looks like it took the bait. Time to get to work!
					209: I'm going to wager a guess and say this is whom the Glassweaver spoke of. Don't get careless.
					210: A new vista to explore!
					211: What a curious place...
					212: The exploration continues.
					213: Seems like this world still has its secrets.
					214: Looks like a new area?
					215: What is this place?
					216: (Laugh)
					217: So this is the Everlasting Light... how dreadful.
					218: Seems to be raining again.
					219: Looks like it's beginning to rain.
					220: An exceptional result! Looks like you didn't even get scratched!
					221: A little too close for comfort... but it worked out in the end.
					222: That could've gone worse, I suppose...!

							1: The Spatial Disk can do a lot of other things, but for now, the Stellar Array is the most important. Remember to check it often!
							2: One last thing.. I can turn energy from other worlds into direct power in the form of Essences. Combining these with other materials should be enough to create powerful Aspected Weapons.

							1: The Spatial Disk has plenty of other uses, but by my hypothesis we don't have access to them yet. Hopefully, as we get stronger, more facets of the Disk will open up to us.
							2: Umm.. what next..? Right. I can turn latent energy from other worlds into crystallized power- an Essence, if you will. You can turn these Essences into Aspected Weapons.

							2: Huh? Sister? No way...
							3: I apologize, Asphodene. This should help. Ring any bells?
							4: Dude. We have GOT to stop meeting like this. The nerve...!
							5: Please, let me explain, Starbearer. In tandem with our galaxy's myriad worlds, there exists Starfarers to aid their denizens. You are familiar with what we do.
							6: As we are conduits of energy, we choose a Starbearer to act as our envoy. You should know that living beings are the best conductors of mana, and we're only partially alive.
							7: However, the First Starfarer's nominee was... unfitting for their role. This is the First Starbearer. From what I know, they seem to have lost their mind and morals.
							8: Now, they continue to roam the galaxy, the Starfarer a thrall to their chosen one's whims. They 'pursue good' through any means necessary, often with casualties.
							9: This is all conjecture, but the destruction is very real. It should go unsaid that we can't let this continue. I'll need your help in the future.
							10: As it stands now, you have little chance of besting them. However, while Asphodene doesn't know it, all Starfarers have an ace up their sleeve: the Stellar Nova.
							11: I've already bequeathed the power to her the second you've won our duel.
							12: That is all for now. I must continue to track the First Starbearer. Good luck- I will have need of you soon.
							13: I know he's a loner, but.. I wish we could have spoken more. Stay safe, Perseus. I can't help but feel he's hiding something from me, though. Just me?
							14: Anyways, he was right. I do feel stronger- and my hair's gone all shiny! This power should be an amazing boon going forward.
							15: Looks like my Stellar Nova is called 'Prototokia Aster.' Perhaps we'll get to use some more once we defeat more powerful foes?
							16: After binding the Stellar Nova Key, you should be able to equip the Stellar Nova through the Spatial Disk, like usual.
							17: You should have some Prismatic Cores already. With their power, I theorize you can upgrade Stellar Novas with crafting.
							18: This is important. You need Stellar Nova Energy to cast Novas. You gain Nova energy in combat, and it depletes outside of combat.
							19: OK. A lot has happened, but this is a huge step forward for us. Please use the Novas well! Bye for now.

							2: We might not look it, but we aren't native to this galaxy. We came after- well, it's hard to explain straight out.
							3: Let's pretend the universe is a lake, right? Okay, good. Now imagine someone started pouring oil into the lake- not something you could miss.
							4: Hopefully that explains what's going on here. We ended up discovering this:
							5: This galaxy- the Moirae galaxy- is freezing over. It's not happening all at once, but the farther away from the center you go, things get worse.
							6: The only reason why I met you is because this planet is uniquely habitable, even this far away from the galaxy's center. You can thank your Sun for that.

							2: Simply combine one of each type of gemstone to create the Stellaglyph. That's pretty much the hardest part taken care of.
							3: Now, placing the Stellaglyph in your home will open up a Gateway you can use with the Celestial Cartography menu to explore the galaxy in what we call a Cosmic Voyage.
							4: Simply select a destination to teleport directly there- quite a novel way of travel, right?
							5: Of course, there's a few downsides. We're transposing you there instead of normal travel (like with a starship) so you'll have most movement abilities unavailable.
							6: Oh, I recommend taking something like a grappling hook to service you on the Cosmic Voyages. Trust me on this one.
							7: That makes sense. Keep in mind you'll need to be near the Gateway to go to other locations- but if you get stuck, you can just teleport home or the Observatory.
							8: Speaking of locations... if you find any foes on your adventures, you can kill them for a chance at some useful items.
							9: Anomaly locations have much greater loot and rarer enemies, but if you stay for too long...
							10: Let's just say there's a whole host of nasties in the galaxy, and they love visiting these places. Once they're alerted to your presence, they'll come hunting.
							11: After visiting an Anomaly, there'll be a long cooldown before you can visit again, so make every visit count.
							12: Through upgrading the Stellaglyph, you can access more Cosmic Voyage Locations, but you'll have to craft the Stellaglyph upgrades yourself- using the Celestriad Root, of course.
							13: One last thing- there exists certain structures called Stellar Foci, which, when placed near your Stellaglyph, will make you stronger during Cosmic Voyages.
							14: They'll be super helpful in the long run, but they're pretty difficult to craft. Maybe we'll find a source somewhere?
							15: Okay, that's it! Did you get all that?

					AstralBonus: The counterattack will always deal critical damage below half health. Restore 5 Stellar Nova Energy upon triggering the counterattack.

		Bestiary: {
			ArbitrationBoss: A horrifying figure encountered within a mysterious location known as Katabasis. While it appears evil to a human, eldritch anomalies such as these know not the concept of malice.
			AstralCell: A strange blue object. It eats water vapor.
			NalhaunBossPhase2: A once mighty monarch, cursed to live eternally by means of a betrayal from his royal court. He persisted alone on an empty planet until the First Starbearer ended his long and tragic reign, as he would be able to interfere with his plans. While he may have stood a chance at his full might, he was burdened by a dreadful civil war tearing his world apart.
			PaintedAttendantA: Utilized by Penthesilea to... smack you in the face. The best mages know when physical violence is the answer.
			PenthesileaBoss: An incredibly powerful mage, the Painted Witch once ruled a planet entirely 'drawn' by her. Ever the trickster, she mastered expert magecraft simply to play pranks upon the works of her colleagues, a testament to her ingenuity. She met her end at the hands of the First Starbearer after a long conflict- if she were to persist, she would interfere with his plans...
			PrismLoot: The latent magical energy of Prismatic Cores can sometimes influence them to drift around the galaxy. Catch one, and you'll be rewarded!
			SpectreOfLight: An otherworldy hero, summoned forth by the First Starbearer to assail this land.
			TsukiyomiBoss: The First Starfarer, Tsukiyomi, who holds dominion over orbiting celestial bodies. The gravitational pull of a planet and its natural satellites gives her power. She led the Warrior of Light astray- using his strength and goodwill to conquer and destroy myriad stars... and yet...
			CastorBoss: The Force of Fire, a Baleborn. The Baleborn are an incredibly competitive race of demonkin, and their blood relations have served only to further kindle the fires of conflict. They are completely engrossed in their duel, aware of nothing but their opponent's actions. Ironically, this has made them quite mediocre fighters against any other opponent. They were utterly destroyed by the First Starbearer, attacking him as he unwittingly interfered with their eternal battle.
			PolluxBoss: The Forces of Ice and Fire, twin Baleborn. The Baleborn are an incredibly competitive race of demonkin, and their blood relations have served only to further kindle the fires of conflict. They are completely engrossed in their duel, aware of nothing but their opponent's actions. Ironically, this has made them quite mediocre fighters against any other opponent. They were utterly destroyed by the First Starbearer, attacking him as he unwittingly interfered with their eternal battle.
			VagrantBoss: The enigmatic Starfarer Perseus. His outward appearance is that of utmost confidence... but he's just kind of a dork trying to look cool. His sisters agree on this. He continues to have power over spatial distances, but seems to have lost the power to control time (but not the moniker.)
			WarriorOfLight: The Warrior of Light, or the First Starbearer, once championed justice in the galaxy through his actions and the aid of his Starfarer. He once ruled a peaceful world, but was forced to watch helplessly as his people met their demise, vowing to never again let others share the same fate- no matter the cost.
			AsteroidWorm: These incredibly hardy creatures have grown the capability to aimlessly drift through the vacuum of space- perhaps not the best depiction of evolution. While their meals are scarce, their need for food is nigh nonexistant. Gifted with a strong outer shell, but low overall attacking strength.
			Soulless: An unfortunate victim of whatever apocalypse befell Caelum. Mana keeps their incarnation alive, but whatever trace of thought they may have once had has long since departed.
			Yojimbo: A mysterious lumenkin, his name seems to change depending on when and where you come across him. He's a bounty hunter, but is willing to part with some knowledge if you pry enough...
			Garridine: A lupine demihuman you discovered residing on a far-flung starship, a blacksmith and gadgeteer. Her manner of speaking belies a high-class upbringing, but the facade tends to drop when she flubs her words (which is often.) Strangely protective of the watch by her side.
			AmethystHeadpiercer: Foot soldier of a wide-reaching paramilitary organization, referred to as the Amethyst. Equipped with a Vortexian powersuit fitted with a jetpack for ease of travel, even in the vacuum of space.
			AmethystSwordsinner: Foot soldier of a wide-reaching paramilitary organization, referred to as the Amethyst. Utilizes a hardlight blade with ferocious efficiency, specifically for countering ranged offense.
			Tsukiyomi2: ???
			ThespianBoss: A legendary alchemist long dead reanimated by a terrifying agent of chaos. For one as far gone as he, you must act as he demands, lest you meet your untimely end...
			StarfarerBoss: Yep, it's us.
			LogicBombEnemy: The payload of a Logic Virus, this bundle of energy tries to dive bomb living creatures to hopefully transform them into more Logic Viruses. However, this works only on robots, so it'll just feel like a ton of hot plasma smacking you in the face, which could be considered worse.
			LogicVirusEnemy: A strange miniscule soldier, the Logic Viruses are characterized by their dastardly payloads and their ability to multiply, causing quite a nuisiance. Too bad they seem to have poor locomotive capabilities in walled environs.
			SemaphoreEnemy: A strange winged device, the Semaphores will dislodge raw data from the Neon Veil's sky and cause it to plummet (hopefully on your beautiful head.)
