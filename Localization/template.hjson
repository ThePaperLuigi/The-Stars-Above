		Bestiary: {
		    Arbitration: A mysterious figure, said to exhibit balance throughout the galaxy. Little is known about this enemy... Was rent asunder by the First Starbearer.
			AstralCell: A strange blue object summoned by the Vagrant of Space and Time. It eats water vapor.
			Nalhaun: A once mighty monarch, cursed to live eternally even as his kingdom crumbed around him. The ability to conjure forth powerful monsters was gifted to him by his final retainer ere she breathed her last. He persisted alone on an empty planet until the First Starbearer ended his long and tragic reign.
			PaintedAttendantA: Utilized by Penthesilea to... smack you in the face. The best mages know when physical violence is the answer.
			Penthesilea: An incredibly powerful mage, the Painted Witch once ruled a planet entirely 'drawn' by her. Ever the trickster, she mastered expert magecraft simply to play pranks upon the works of her colleagues, a testament to her ingenuity. She met her end at the hands of the First Starbearer after a long conflict.
			PrismLoot: The latent magical energy of Prismatic Cores can sometimes influence them to drift around the galaxy. Catch one, and you'll be rewarded!
			SpectreOfLight: An otherworldy hero, summoned forth by the First Starbearer to assail this land.
			Tsukiyomi2: The First Starfarer, Tsukiyomi, who holds dominion over orbiting celestial bodies. The gravitational pull of a planet and its natural satellites gives her power. She led the Warrior of Light astray- using his strength and goodwill to conquer and destroy myriad stars... and yet...
			VagrantOfSpaceAndTime: The enigmatic Starfarer Perseus. His outward appearance is that of utmost confidence... but he's just kind of a dork trying to look cool. His sisters agree on this.
			WarriorOfLight: The Warrior of Light, or the First Starbearer, once championed justice in the galaxy through his actions, and the aid of his Starfarer. He once ruled a peaceful world, but was forced to watch helplessly as his people met their demise, vowing to never again let others share the same fate- no matter the cost.
